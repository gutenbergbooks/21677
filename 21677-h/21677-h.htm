<h2><a id="c0">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p>Francis Bacon, in one of his prose fragments,
draws a memorable distinction between "arts
mechanical" and "sciences of conceit." "In
arts mechanical," he says, "the first device comes
shortest, and time addeth and perfecteth. But in
sciences of conceit the first author goeth farthest,
and time leeseth and corrupteth.... In the
former, many wits and industries contributed in
one. In the latter, many men's wits spent to
deprave the wit of one."</p>

<p>I fear that literary criticism of the kind that
I propose to myself in these chapters on Milton
must be classified with the "sciences of conceit."
Indeed, Bacon puts it out of question that he himself
would so have regarded it, for he goes on to
explain how, after the deliverances of a master,
"then begin men to aspire to the second prizes, to
be a profound interpreter and commentor, to be
a sharp champion and defender, to be a methodical
compounder and abridger. And this is the
<span class="pb" id="pg_2">[2]</span>
unfortunate succession of wits which the world
hath yet had, whereby the patrimony of all knowledge
goeth not on husbanded and improved, but
wasted and decayed."</p>

<p>The blow is aimed at the scholastic philosophers,
but it falls heavy on the critics of literature, on all
who "aspire to the second prizes," or who think
"that a borrowed light can increase the original
light from whom it is taken." It is a searching
arraignment of all who set themselves to expound
in words the meaning and purpose of a master
of verbal expression. Yet the very breadth of the
indictment brings comfort and a means of escape.
For the chief difficulties of an attempt to understand
and judge Milton are difficulties inherent in
the nature, not only of all criticism in the large
sense, but also of all reading. In this association
with great spirits which we call reading we receive
but what we give, and take away only what we are
fit to carry. Milton himself has stated the doctrine
in its most absolute form, and has sought an enhanced
authority for it by attributing it to the
Christ--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t10">Who reads</div>
<div class="t0">Incessantly, and to his reading brings not</div>
<div class="t0">A spirit and judgment equal or superior</div>
<div class="t0">(And what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek?)</div>
<div class="t0">Uncertain and unsettled still remains,</div>
<div class="t0">Deep versed in books and shallow in himself,</div>
<div class="t0">Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys</div>
<span class="pb" id="pg_3">[3]</span>
<div class="t0">And trifles for choice matters, worth a spunge,</div>
<div class="t0">As children gathering pebbles on the shore.</div>
</div>

<p>Literally taken, this is the negation of all the
higher functions of criticism, and the paralysis of
all learning. Only his peers, it is argued, can
read Shakespeare intelligently; and, as if that did
not give him few enough readers, they are further
told that they will be wasting their time! But
love, unlike this proud Stoicism, is humble, and
contented with a little. I would put my apology
in the language of love rather than of philosophy.
I know that in Shakespeare, or in Milton, or in
any rare nature, as in Faire Virtue, the mistress of
Philarete--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">There is some conceal&egrave;d thing</div>
<div class="t0">So each gazer limiting,</div>
<div class="t0">He can see no more of merit</div>
<div class="t0">Than beseems his worth and spirit.</div>
</div>

<p>The appreciation of a great author asks knowledge
and industry before it may be attempted,
but in the end it is the critic, not the author, who
is judged by it, and, where his sympathies have
been too narrow, or his sight too dim, condemned
without reprieve, and buried without a tombstone.</p>

<p>Imperfect sympathy, that eternal vice of criticism,
is sometimes irremediable, sometimes caused
by imperfect knowledge. It takes forms as various
as the authors whom it misjudges. In the case of
Shakespeare, when we attempt to estimate him, to
<span class="pb" id="pg_4">[4]</span>
gauge him, to see him from all sides, we become
almost painfully conscious of his immensity. We
can build no watch-tower high enough to give us a
bird's-eye view of that "globe of miraculous continents."
We are out of breath when we attempt
to accompany him on his excursions, where he,</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t4">through strait, rough, dense, or rare,</div>
<div class="t0">With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,</div>
<div class="t0">And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.</div>
</div>

<p>He moves so easily and so familiarly among human
passions and human emotions, is so completely at
home in all societies and all companies, that he
makes us feel hide-bound, prejudiced and ill-bred,
by the side of him. We have to widen our
conception of human nature in order to think of
him as a man. How hard a thing it is to conceive
of Shakespeare as of a human spirit, embodied
and conditioned, whose affections, though higher
mounted than ours, yet, when they stooped, stooped
with the like wing, is witnessed by all biographies
of Shakespeare, and by many thousands of the
volumes of criticism and commentary that have
been written on his works. One writer is content
to botanise with him--to study plant-lore, that is,
with a theatrical manager, in his hard-earned leisure,
for teacher. Another must needs read the Bible
with him, although, when all is said, Shakespeare's
study was but little on the Bible. Others elect to
<span class="pb" id="pg_5">[5]</span>
keep him to music, astronomy, law, hunting, hawking,
fishing. He is a good companion out of doors,
and some would fain keep him there, to make a
country gentleman of him. His incorrigible preoccupation
with humanity, the ruling passion and
employment of his life, is beyond the range of their
complete sympathy; they like to catch him out of
hours, to draw him aside and bespeak his interest,
for a few careless minutes, in the trades and pastimes
that bulk so largely and so seriously in their
own perspective of life. They hardly know what
to make of his "unvalued book"; but they know
that he was a great man, and to have bought a
wool-fell or a quarter of mutton from him, that
would have been something! Only the poet-critics
attempt to see life, however brokenly, through
Shakespeare's eyes, to let their enjoyment keep
attendance upon his. And from their grasp, too,
he escapes by sheer excess.</p>

<p>In the case of Milton the imperfection of our
sympathy is due to other causes. In the first
place, we know him as we do not know Shakespeare.
The history of his life can be, and has
been, minutely written. The affairs of his time,
political and religious, have been recorded with
enormous wealth of detail; and this wealth, falling
into fit hands, has given us those learned modern
historians to whom the seventeenth century means
a period of five thousand two hundred and
<span class="pb" id="pg_6">[6]</span>
eighteen weeks. Milton's own attitude towards
these affairs is in no way obscure; he has explained
it with great fulness and candour in
numerous publications, so that it would be easy
to draw up a declaration of his chief tenets in
politics and religion. The slanders of his adversaries
he met again and again with lofty passages
of self-revelation. "With me it fares now," he
remarks in one of these, "as with him whose
outward garment hath been injured and ill-bedighted;
for having no other shift, what help
but to turn the inside outwards, especially if the
lining be of the same, or, as it is sometimes, much
better." In his poetry, too, he delights to reveal
himself, to take the knowing reader into his
confidence, to honour the fit audience with a
confession.</p>

<p>But the difficulty is there none the less. Few
critics have found Milton too wide or too large
for them; many have found him too narrow,
which is another form of imperfect sympathy.
His lack of humour has alienated the interest of
thousands. His ardent advocacy of toleration in
the noblest of his prose treatises has been belittled
by a generation which prides itself on that flaccid
form of benevolence, and finds the mere repeal of
the Licensing Act the smallest part of it. His
pamphlets on divorce and on government have
earned him the reputation of a theorist and
<span class="pb" id="pg_7">[7]</span>
dreamer. The shrewd practical man finds it
easy to despise him. The genial tolerant man,
whose geniality of demeanour towards others is a
kind of quit-rent paid for his own moral laxity,
regards him as a Pharisee. The ready humourist
devises a pleasant and cheap entertainment by
dressing Adam and Eve in modern garments
and discussing their relations in the jargon of
modish frivolity. Even the personal history of
the poet has been made to contribute to the gaiety
of nations, and the flight of Mary Powell, the
first Mrs. Milton, from the house in Aldersgate
Street, has become something of a stock comic
episode in the history of English literature. So
heavy is the tax paid, even by a poet, for deficiency
in breadth and humour. Almost all men are less
humorous than Shakespeare; but most men are
more humorous than Milton, and these, it is to
be feared, having suffered themselves to be
dragooned by the critics into professing a distant
admiration for <i>Paradise Lost</i>, have paid their last
and utmost tribute to the genius of its author.</p>

<p>It may be admitted without hesitation that his
lonely greatness rather forces admiration on us
than attracts us. That unrelenting intensity;
that lucidity, as clear as air and as hard as agate;
that passion which burns with a consuming heat
or with a blinding light in all his writings, have
endeared him to none. It is impossible to take
<span class="pb" id="pg_8">[8]</span>
one's ease with Milton, to induce him to forget
his principles for a moment in the name of social
pleasure. The most genial of his personal sonnets
is addressed to Henry Lawrence, the son of the
President of Cromwell's Council, and is an invitation
to dinner. The repast promised is "light
and choice"; the guest is apostrophised, somewhat
formidably, as "Lawrence, of virtuous father,
virtuous son," and is reminded, before he has
dined, that</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">He who of these delights can judge, and spare</div>
<div class="t0">To interpose them oft, is not unwise.</div>
</div>

<p>But the qualities that make Milton a poor
boon-companion are precisely those which combine
to raise his style to an unexampled loftiness,
a dignity that bears itself easily in society greater
than human. To attain to this height it was
needful that there should be no aimless expatiation
of the intellect, no facile diffusion of the sympathies
over the wide field of human activity and
human character. All the strength of mind and
heart and will that was in Milton went into the
process of raising himself. He is like some giant
palm-tree; the foliage that sprang from it as it
grew has long since withered, the stem rises
gaunt and bare; but high up above, outlined
against the sky, is a crown of perennial verdure.</p>

<p>It is essential for the understanding of Milton
<span class="pb" id="pg_9">[9]</span>
that we should take account of the rare simplicity
of his character. No subtleties; no tricks of the
dramatic intellect, which dresses itself in a hundred
masquerading costumes and peeps out of a thousand
spy-holes; no development, one might almost
say, only training, and that self-imposed. There
is but one Milton, and he is throughout one
and the same, in his life, in his prose, and in his
verse; from those early days, when we find him,
an uncouth swain,</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">With eager thought warbling his Doric lay,</div>
</div>

<p>to the last days when, amid a swarm of disasters,
he approved himself like Samson, and earned for
himself the loftiest epitaph in the language, his
own--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail</div>
<div class="t0">Or knock the breast; no weakness, no contempt,</div>
<div class="t0">Dispraise, or blame; nothing but well and fair,</div>
<div class="t0">And what may quiet us in a death so noble.</div>
</div>

<p>The world has not wholly misunderstood or
failed to appreciate this extraordinary character,
as one curious piece of evidence will serve to
show. Milton is one of the most egotistic of
poets. He makes no secret of the high value he
sets upon his gifts--"gifts of God's imparting,"
as he calls them, "which I boast not, but thankfully
acknowledge, and fear also lest at my
certain account they be reckoned to me many
<span class="pb" id="pg_10">[10]</span>
rather than few." Before he has so much as begun
his great poem he covenants with his reader "that
for some few years yet I may go on trust with
him toward the payment of what I am now indebted,
as being a work not to be raised from the
heat of youth or the vapours of wine; ... nor
to be obtained by the invocation of dame Memory
and her siren daughters, but by devout prayer to
that eternal Spirit, who can enrich with all utterance
and knowledge, and sends out his seraphim,
with the hallowed fire of his altar, to touch and
purify the lips of whom he pleases; to this must
be added industrious and select reading, steady
observation, insight into all seemly and generous
arts and affairs; till which in some measure be
compassed, at mine own peril and cost, I refuse
not to sustain this expectation from as many as
are not loth to hazard so much credulity upon the
best pledges that I can give them." And when
he came to redeem his pledge, in the very opening
lines of his epic, trusting to the same inspiration,
he challenges the supremacy of the ancients by his</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t8">adventrous song</div>
<div class="t0">That with no middle flight intends to soar</div>
<div class="t0">Above the Aonian mount, while it pursues</div>
<div class="t0">Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.</div>
</div>

<p>"This man cuts us all out, and the Ancients
too," Dryden is reported to have said. But this
<span class="pb" id="pg_11">[11]</span>
man intended to do no less, and formally announced
his intention. It is impossible to outface Milton,
or to abash him with praise. His most enthusiastic
eulogists are compelled merely to echo the
remarks of his earliest and greatest critic, himself.
Yet with all this, none of the later critics, not the
most cavalier nor the dullest, has dared to call him
vain. His estimate of himself, offered as simple
fact, has been accepted in the same spirit, and one
abyss of ineptitude still yawns for the heroic folly,
or the clownish courage, of the New Criticism.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_12">[12]</div>


<h2><a id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br />JOHN MILTON</a></h2>

<p>John Milton, the son of a middle-aged scrivener,
was born on Friday, December the 9th, 1608, at
his father's house in Bread Street, Cheapside; and
died on Sunday, November the 8th, 1674, in a
small house, with but one room on a floor, in
Artillery Walk, Bunhill Fields, London. Of his
father the records that remain show him to have
been a convinced member of the Puritan party in
the Church, a man of liberal culture and intelligence,
a lover of music (which taste Milton inherited),
a wise and generous friend to the son
who became a poet. We owe it to his wisdom
rather than to his prosperity that Milton was
allowed to live at home without any ostensible
profession until he was thirty years of age and
more.</p>

<p>For the first sixteen years of his life Milton
was educated partly at home, by a Presbyterian
tutor called Thomas Young, partly at St. Paul's
<span class="pb" id="pg_13">[13]</span>
School, which he attended for some years as a day-scholar.
From his twelfth year onward he was an
omnivorous reader, and before he left school had
written some boyish verses, void of merit. The
next fourteen years of his life, after leaving school,
were spent at Cambridge, in Buckinghamshire, and
in foreign travel, so that he was thirty years old
before he lived continuously in London again.</p>

<p>We know pretty well how he spent his time at
Cambridge and at Horton, sedulously turning over
the Greek and Latin classics, dreaming of immortality.
We know less about his early years in
London, where there were wider and better opportunities
of gaining an insight into "all seemly and
generous arts and affairs." London was a great
centre of traffic, a motley crowd of adventurers
and traders even in those days, and the boy
Milton must often have wandered down to the
river below London Bridge to see the ships come
in. His poems are singularly full of figures
drawn from ships and shipping, some of them
bookish in their origin, others which may have
been suggested by the sight of ships. Now it is
Satan, who, after his fateful journey through chaos,
nears the world,</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">And like a weather-beaten vessel holds</div>
<div class="t0">Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn.</div>
</div>

<p>Now it is Dalila, whom the Chorus behold approaching.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_14">[14]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Like a stately ship</div>
<div class="t0">Of Tarsus, bound for the isles</div>
<div class="t0">Of Javan or Gadire,</div>
<div class="t0">With all her bravery on, and tackle trim,</div>
<div class="t0">Sails filled, and streamers waving,</div>
<div class="t0">Courted by all the winds that hold them play.</div>
</div>

<p>Or, again, it is Samson reproaching himself,</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Who, like a foolish pilot, have shipwracked</div>
<div class="t0">My vessel trusted to me from above,</div>
<div class="t0">Gloriously rigged.</div>
</div>

<p>The bulk of Satan is compared to the great sea-beast
Leviathan, beheld off the coast of Norway by</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">The pilot of some small night-founder'd skiff.</div>
</div>

<p>In his approach to the happy garden the Adversary
is likened to</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t10">them who sail</div>
<div class="t0">Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past</div>
<div class="t0">Mozambic, off at sea north-east winds blow</div>
<div class="t0">Sabaean odours from the spicy shore</div>
<div class="t0">Of Araby the Blest, with such delay</div>
<div class="t0">Well pleased they slack their course, and many a league</div>
<div class="t0">Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles;</div>
<div class="t0">So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend.</div>
</div>

<p>And when he draws near to Eve in the rose-thicket,</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t8">sidelong he works his way,</div>
<div class="t0">As when a ship, by skilful steersman wrought,</div>
<div class="t0">Nigh river's mouth, or foreland, where the wind</div>
<div class="t0">Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail.</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_15">[15]</div>

<p>There is nothing here that is not within the
reach of any inland reader, but Milton's choice of
nautical similitudes may serve to remind us how
much of the interest of Old London centred round
its port. Here were to be heard those tales of
far-sought adventure and peril which gave even
to the boisterous life of Elizabethan London an air
of triviality and security. Hereby came in "the
variety of fashions and foreign stuffs," which Fynes
Moryson, writing in Milton's childhood, compares
to the stars of heaven and the sands of the sea for
number. All sorts of characters, nationalities, and
costumes were daily to be seen in Paul's Walk,
adjoining Milton's school. One sort interests us
pre-eminently. "In the general pride of England,"
says Fynes Moryson, "there is no fit difference
made of degrees; for very Bankrupts, Players,
and Cutpurses go apparelled like gentlemen."
Shakespeare was alive during the first seven years
of Milton's life, and was no doubt sometimes a
visitor to the Mermaid, a stone's throw from the
scrivener's house. Perhaps his cloak brushed the
child Milton in the street. Milton was born in
the golden age of the drama, and a score of
masterpieces were put upon the London stage
while he was in his cradle. But the golden age
passed rapidly; the quality of the drama degenerated
and the opposition to it grew strong before
he was of years to attend a play. Perhaps he
<span class="pb" id="pg_16">[16]</span>
never saw a play by the masters during his boyhood,
and his visits</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t4">to the well-trod stage anon,</div>
<div class="t0">If Jonson's learned sock be on,</div>
<div class="t0">Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,</div>
<div class="t0">Warble his native woodnotes wild,</div>
</div>

<p>were either excursions of the imagination or belong
to his later occasional sojourns in London. In his
<i>Eikonoklastes</i> he quotes certain lines from <i>Richard
III.</i>, and here and there in his prose, as well as in
his verse, there are possibly some faint reminiscences
of Shakespearian phrases. So, for instance, in <i>The
Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</i>, he seems to
echo a famous speech of Macbeth, while he claims
that his remedy of free divorce "hath the virtue to
soften and dispel rooted and knotty sorrows, and
without enchantment." But these are doubtless
the memories of reading. In the <i>Apology for
Smectymnuus</i>, when he has to reply to the charge
that he "haunted playhouses" during his college
days, he retorts the charge, it is true, rather than
denies it. Yet the retort bespeaks a certain
severity and preciseness in judging of plays and
their actors, which can hardly have found gratification
in the licenses and exuberances of the contemporary
drama. It was not difficult, he remarks,
to see plays, "when in the Colleges so many of
the young divines, and those in next aptitude to
divinity, have been seen so often upon the stage,
<span class="pb" id="pg_17">[17]</span>
writhing and unboning their clergy limbs to all
the antic and dishonest gestures of Trinculoes,
buffoons, and bawds." "If it be unlawful," he
continues, "to sit and behold a mercenary
comedian personating that which is least unseemly
for a hireling to do, how much more blameful is it
to endure the sight of as vile things acted by
persons either entered, or presently to enter into
the ministry; and how much more foul and
ignominious for them to be the actors!"</p>

<p>It was, at least, a happy chance that the first of
Milton's verses to appear in print should have
been <i>An Epitaph on the Admirable Dramatick Poet,
W. Shakespeare</i>, contributed to the Second Folio
in 1632. The main interests of the household at
the Spread Eagle in Bread Street must have been
far enough remote from the doings of the companies
of players. John Milton the elder would
probably have agreed with Sir Thomas Bodley,
who called plays "riffe-raffes," and declared that
they should never come into his library. The
Hampton Court Conference, the Synod of Dort,
the ever-widening divisions in the Church, between
Arminian and Calvinist, between Prelatist
and Puritan, were probably subjects of a nearer
interest, even to the poet in his youth, than the
production of new or old plays upon the stage.
Milton's childhood was spent in the very twilight
of the Elizabethan age; it was greatly fortunate
<span class="pb" id="pg_18">[18]</span>
for him, and for us, that he caught the after-glow
of the sunset upon his face. He read Spenser
while Spenser was still the dominant influence in
English poetry. "He hath confessed to me,"
said Dryden, "that Spenser was his original,"--an
incredible statement unless we understand
"original" in the sense of his earliest admiration,
his poetic godfather who first won him to poetry.
He read Shakespeare and Jonson in the first
editions. He read Sylvester's translation of <i>Du
Bartas, His Divine Weekes and Workes</i>; and
perhaps thence conceived the first vague idea of a
poem on a kindred subject. It is necessary to
insist on his English masters, because, although the
greater part of his time and study was devoted to
the classics, the instrument that he was to use was
learned in a native school. His metre, his magnificent
vocabulary, his unerring phraseology, took
learning and practice. He attached a high value
to his study of English poetry. When he spoke
of "our sage and serious Spenser (whom I dare be
known to think a better teacher than Scotus or
Aquinas)," he was conscious that he was maintaining
what seemed a bold paradox in an age when
scholasticism still controlled education. It is
pleasant to think of Milton during these early
years, whether in London or at Christ's College,
in his "calm and pleasing solitariness, fed with
cheerful and confident thoughts," before ever he
<span class="pb" id="pg_19">[19]</span>
had a hint that he must perforce "embark in a
troubled sea of noises and hoarse disputes, put
from beholding the bright countenance of truth in
the quiet and still air of delightful studies." From
the first, we may be sure, he read the poets as one
poet reads another, and apprenticed himself to
them for their craft. He was never drawn out of
the highroad of art by the minuter and more entangling
allurements of scholarship. In one of his
Divorce pamphlets he tells, with the inevitable
touch of pride, how he never could delight in long
citations, much less in whole traductions, "whether
it be natural disposition or education in me, or
that my mother bore me a speaker of what God
made mine own, and not a translator."</p>

<p>Milton was intended by his family, and by his own
early resolves, for the service of the Church. The
growing unrest, therefore, in matters ecclesiastical
during the early part of the seventeenth century
could not but affect him. The various parties and
tendencies in the Church of England had never,
since the Reformation, attained to a condition of
stable equilibrium. But the settlement under
Elizabeth was strengthened, and the parties bound
together for thirty years, by the ever-present fear
of Rome. When that fear was allayed, and the
menace that hung over the very existence of the
nation removed by the defeat of the Armada, the
differences within the Church broke out afresh, and
<span class="pb" id="pg_20">[20]</span>
waxed fiercer every year. Shakespeare grew to
manhood during the halcyon years between the
Marian persecutions and the Marprelate pamphlets--a
kind of magic oasis, which gave us our
English Renaissance. Milton's youth breathed a
very different air. The Church, as it was, pleased
hardly any party. Much of the old temple had
been hastily pulled down; the new government
offices that were to replace it had as yet been
but partially built, and commanded no general
approval. Considered as a social organisation,
moreover, the Church throughout large parts of the
country had fallen into a state not unlike decay.
Richard Baxter, whose testimony there is no
sufficient reason to reject, tells of its state in Shropshire
during the years of his youth, from 1615
onwards:--"We lived in a country that had but
little preaching at all: In the Village where I was
born there was four Readers successively in Six
years time, ignorant Men, and two of them
immoral in their lives; who were all my School-masters.
In the Village where my Father lived,
there was a Reader of about Eighty years of Age
that never preached, and had two Churches about
Twenty miles distant: His Eyesight failing him,
he said Common-Prayer without Book; but for
the Reading of the Psalms and Chapters he got a
Common Thresher and Day-Labourer one year,
and a Taylor another year: (for the Clerk could
<span class="pb" id="pg_21">[21]</span>
not read well): And at last he had a Kinsman of
his own (the excellentest Stage-player in all the
Country, and a good Gamester and good Fellow)
that got Orders and supplied one of his Places....
After him another Neighbour's Son took
Orders, when he had been a while an Attorney's
Clerk, and a common Drunkard, and tipled himself
into so great Poverty that he had no other way to
live.... These were the School-masters of my
Youth ... who read Common Prayer on Sundays
and Holy Days, and taught School and
tipled on the Weekdays, and whipt the Boys when
they were drunk, so that we changed them very
oft. Within a few miles about us were near a
dozen more Ministers that were near Eighty years
old apiece, and never preached; poor ignorant
Readers, and most of them of Scandalous Lives."
Some few there were, Baxter admits, who preached
in the neighbourhood, but any one who went to
hear them "was made the Derision of the Vulgar
Rabble under the odious Name of a <i>Puritane</i>."</p>

<p>In one of his Latin letters written from Cambridge,
Milton himself speaks of the ignorance of
those designed for the profession of divinity, how
they knew little or nothing of literature and philosophy.
The high prelacy and ritualism of Laud
on the one hand, the Puritan movement on the
other, each in some measure a protest against this
state of things, were at fierce variance with each
<span class="pb" id="pg_22">[22]</span>
other, and Milton's ear, from his youth upward,
was "pealed with noises loud and ruinous." The
age of Shakespeare was irrecoverably past, and it
was impossible for any but a few imperturbable
Cyrenaics, like Herrick, to "fleet the time carelessly,
as they did in the golden world." The
large indifference of Shakespeare to current politics
was impossible for Milton. "I had as lief be a
Brownist as a politician," said the folly of Sir
Andrew Aguecheek and the wisdom of Shakespeare.
But now the Brownists and the politicians
had it their own way; and Milton was something
of both.</p>

<p>His notable early poems, written at College and
during his retreat in Buckinghamshire, have therefore
a singular interest and pathos. He was not
long for the world in which these poems move
with so ineffable a native grace. They are the
poems of his youth, instinct with the sensibility
of youth, and of a delicate and richly nurtured
imagination. But they are also the poems of an
age that was closing, and they have a touch of the
sadness of evening. "I know not," says Dr.
Johnson, speaking of <i>L'Allegro</i> and <i>Il Penseroso</i>,
"whether the characters are kept sufficiently apart.
No mirth can indeed be found in his melancholy,
but I am afraid that I always meet some melancholy
in his mirth." It is true; for both characters
are Milton himself, who embodies in separate
<span class="pb" id="pg_23">[23]</span>
poems the cheerful and pensive elements of his own
nature--and already his choice is made. There is
something disinterested and detached about his
sketches of the merriment which he takes part
in only as a silent onlooker, compared with the
profound sincerity of the lines--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">And may at last my weary age</div>
<div class="t0">Find out the peaceful hermitage,</div>
<div class="t0">The hairy gown and mossy cell,</div>
<div class="t0">Where I may sit and rightly spell</div>
<div class="t0">Of every star that heaven doth shew,</div>
<div class="t0">And every herb that sips the dew,</div>
<div class="t0">Till old experience do attain</div>
<div class="t0">To something like prophetic strain.</div>
</div>

<p>The rising tide of political passion submerged
the solemn Arcadia of his early fancies. Like
Lycidas, he was carried far from the flowers and
the shepherds to visit "the bottom of the monstrous
world." Hence there may be made a whole
index of themes, touched on by Milton in his
early poems, as if in promise, of which no fulfilment
is to be found in the greater poems of his
maturity. His political career under the Commonwealth
is often treated, both by those who applaud
and by those who lament it, as if it were the
merest interlude between two poetic periods. It
was not so; political passion dominates and informs
all his later poems, dictating even their
subjects. How was it possible for him to choose
King Arthur and his Round Table for the subject
<span class="pb" id="pg_24">[24]</span>
of his epic, as he had intended in his youthful
days; when chivalry and the spirit of chivalry had
fought its last fight on English soil, full in the
sight of all men, round the forlorn banner of King
Charles? The policy of Laud and Stratford kept
Milton out of the Church, and sent him into
retirement at Horton; the same policy, it may be
plausibly conjectured, had something to do with
the change in the subject of his long-meditated
epic. From the very beginning of the civil troubles
contemporary events leave their mark on all his
writings. The topical bias (so to call it) is very
noticeable in many of the subjects tentatively
jotted down by him on the paper that is now in
the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. The
corrupted clergy, who make so splendid and, as
some think, so irrelevant an appearance in <i>Lycidas</i>,
figure frequently, either directly or by implication,
in the long list of themes.</p>

<p>Without misgiving or regret, when the time
came, Milton shut the gate on the sequestered
paradise of his youth, and hastened downward to
join the fighters in the plain. Before we follow
him we may well "interpose a little ease" by
looking at some of the beauties proper to the
earlier poems, and listening to some of the
simple pastoral melodies that were drowned when
the organ began to blow. <i>L'Allegro</i> is full of
them--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_25">[25]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Sometimes, with secure delight,</div>
<div class="t0">The upland hamlets will invite,</div>
<div class="t0">When the merry bells ring round,</div>
<div class="t0">And the jocund rebecks sound</div>
<div class="t0">To many a youth and many a maid</div>
<div class="t0">Dancing in the chequered shade,</div>
<div class="t0">And young and old come forth to play</div>
<div class="t0">On a sunshine holiday.</div>
</div>

<p>That is Merry England of Shakespeare's time.
But already the controversy concerning the <i>Book
of Sports</i> had begun to darken the air. Already
the Maypole, that "great stinking idol," as an
Elizabethan Puritan called it, had been doomed to
destruction. Some years before <i>L'Allegro</i> was
written, a bard, who hailed from Leeds, had lamented
its downfall in the country of his nativity--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Happy the age, and harmelesse were the dayes,</div>
<div class="t">(For then true love and amity was found)</div>
<div class="t0">When every village did a May-pole raise,</div>
<div class="t">And Whitson Ales and May games did abound;</div>
<div class="t0">And all the lusty Yonkers in a rout</div>
<div class="t0">With merry Lasses danced the rod about;</div>
<div class="t0">Then friendship to their banquets bid the guests,</div>
<div class="t0">And poor men far'd the better for their feasts.</div>
</div>

<p>The next verse recalls that scene in <i>The Winter's
Tale</i> where Shakespeare draws a vivid picture of
Elizabethan country merrymaking--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">The Lords of Castles, Manners, Townes, and Towers</div>
<div class="t">Rejoyc'd when they beheld the Farmers flourish,</div>
<div class="t0">And would come down unto the Summer-Bowers</div>
<div class="t">To see the Country gallants dance the Morrice,</div>
<span class="pb" id="pg_26">[26]</span>
<div class="t0">And sometimes with his tenant's handsome daughter</div>
<div class="t0">Would fall in liking, and espouse her after</div>
<div class="t0">Unto his Serving-man, and for her portion</div>
<div class="t0">Bestow on him some farme, without extortion.</div>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Alas poore Maypoles, what should be the cause</div>
<div class="t">That you were almost banish't from the earth?</div>
<div class="t0">You never were rebellious to the lawes,</div>
<div class="t">Your greatest crime was harmelesse honest mirth;</div>
<div class="t0">What fell malignant spirit was there found</div>
<div class="t">To cast your tall <i>Piramides</i> to ground?</div>
<div class="t0"><span class="gsw">*      *      *      *      *</span></div>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">And you my native towne, which was of old,</div>
<div class="t">(When as thy Bon-fires burn'd and May-poles stood,</div>
<div class="t0">And when thy Wassell-cups were uncontrol'd)</div>
<div class="t">The Summer Bower of Peace and neighbourhood,</div>
<div class="t0">Although since these went down, thou ly'st forlorn,</div>
<div class="t0">By factious schismes and humours over-borne,</div>
<div class="t0">Some able hand I hope thy rod will raise,</div>
<div class="t0">That thou maist see once more thy happy daies.</div>
</div>

<p>The hopes of the bard of Leeds were fulfilled
at the Restoration. Merriment, of a sort, came
back to England; but it found no congenial acceptance
from Milton. The Court roysterers, the
Hectors, Nickers, Scourers, and Mohocks, among
whom were numbered Sedley and Rochester, and
others of the best poets of the day, are celebrated
by him incidentally in those lines, unsurpassable
for sombre magnificence, which he appends to his
account of Belial--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">In courts and palaces he also reigns,</div>
<div class="t0">And in luxurious cities, where the noise</div>
<span class="pb" id="pg_27">[27]</span>
<div class="t0">Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,</div>
<div class="t0">And injury and outrage; and, when night</div>
<div class="t0">Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons</div>
<div class="t0">Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.</div>
</div>

<p>The public festivals of these later days are
glanced at in <i>Samson Agonistes</i>--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t2">Lords are lordliest in their wine;</div>
<div class="t0">And the well-feasted priest then soonest fired</div>
<div class="t0">With zeal, if aught religion seem concerned;</div>
<div class="t0">No less the people on their holy-days</div>
<div class="t0">Impetuous, insolent, unquenchable.</div>
</div>

<p>There is no relaxation, no trace of innocent
lightheartedness, in any of the later poems. Even
the garden of Paradise, where some gentle mirth
might perhaps be permissible, is tenanted by grave
livers, majestic, but not sprightly. In <i>L' Allegro</i> the
morning song of the milk-maid is "blithe," and
the music of the village dance is "jocund." But
Eve is described as "jocund" and "blithe" only
when she is intoxicated by the mortal fruit of the
tree; and the note of gaiety that is heard faintly,
like a distant echo, in the earlier poems, is never
sounded again by Milton.</p>

<p>So it is also with other things. The flowers
scattered on the laureate hearse of Lycidas make
a brighter, more various, and withal a homelier
display than ever meets the eye in the Hesperian
wildernesses of Eden. Or take the world of fairy
lore that Milton inherited from the Elizabethans--a
<span class="pb" id="pg_28">[28]</span>
world to which not only Shakespeare, but also
laborious and arrogant poet-scholars like Jonson
and Drayton had free right of entry. Milton,
too, could write of the fairies--in his youth--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">With stories told of many a feat,</div>
<div class="t0">How Faery Mab the junkets eat.</div>
</div>

<p>But even in <i>Comus</i> the most exquisite passage of
fairy description is put into the mouth of Comus
himself, chief of the band of ugly-headed monsters
in glistering apparel--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">The sounds and seas, with all their finny drove,</div>
<div class="t0">Now to the moon in wavering morrice move;</div>
<div class="t0">And on the tawny sands and shelves</div>
<div class="t0">Trip the pert fairies and the dapper elves.</div>
<div class="t0">By dimpled brook and fountain-brim,</div>
<div class="t0">The wood-nymphs decked with daisies trim,</div>
<div class="t0">Their merry wakes and pastimes keep:</div>
<div class="t0">What hath night to do with sleep?</div>
</div>

<p>The song and the dance are broken off, never
to be resumed, when the staid footfall of the lady
is heard approaching. Milton cannot draw ugliness;
it turns into beauty or majesty on his hands.
Satan has a large and enthusiastic party among
readers of <i>Paradise Lost</i>. Comus, we are told,
stands for a whole array of ugly vices--riot,
intemperance, gluttony, and luxury. But what a
delicate monster he is, and what a ravishing lyric
strain he is master of! The pleasure that Milton
forswore was a young god, the companion of Love
<span class="pb" id="pg_29">[29]</span>
and Youth, not an aged Silenus among the wine-skins.
He viewed and described one whole realm
of pagan loveliness, and then he turned his face the
other way, and never looked back. Love is of the
valley, and he lifted his eyes to the hills. His
guiding star was not Christianity, which in its
most characteristic and beautiful aspects had no
fascination for him, but rather that severe and self-centred
ideal of life and character which is called
Puritanism. It is not a creed for weak natures;
so that as the nominal religion of a whole populace
it has inevitably fallen into some well-merited disrepute.
Puritanism for him was not a body of
law to be imposed outwardly on a gross and timid
people, but an inspiration and a grace that falls
from Heaven upon choice and rare natures--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Nor do I name of men the common rout,</div>
<div class="t0">That, wandering loose about,</div>
<div class="t0">Grow up and perish as the summer fly,</div>
<div class="t0">Heads without name, no more remember'd;</div>
</div>

<p>so sings the Chorus in <i>Samson Agonistes</i>--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">But such as thou hast solemnly elected,</div>
<div class="t0">With gifts and graces eminently adorned,</div>
<div class="t0">To some great work, thy glory,</div>
<div class="t0">And people's safety, which in part they effect.</div>
</div>

<p>Under one form or another Puritanism is to be
found in almost all religions, and in many systems
of philosophy. Milton's Puritanism enabled him
<span class="pb" id="pg_30">[30]</span>
to combine his classical and Biblical studies, to
reconcile his pagan and Christian admirations,
Stoicism, and the Quakers. It was with no sense
of incongruity that he gave to the Christ a speech
in praise of--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Quintus, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus,...</div>
<div class="t0">Who could do mighty things, and could contemn</div>
<div class="t0">Riches, though offered from the hand of Kings.</div>
</div>

<p>To reject common ambitions, to refuse common
enticements, to rule passions, desires, and fears,
"neither to change, nor falter, nor repent,"--this
was the wisdom and this the virtue that he set
before himself. There is no beatific vision to keep
his eyes from wandering among the shows of earth.
Milton's heaven is colder than his earth, the home
of Titans, whose employ is political and martial.
When his imagination deals with earthly realities,
the noble melancholy of the Greeks lies upon it.
His last word on human life might be translated
into Greek with no straining and no loss of
meaning--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">His servants He, with new acquist</div>
<div class="t0">Of true experience from this great event,</div>
<div class="t0">With peace and consolation hath dismissed,</div>
<div class="t0">And calm of mind, all passion spent.</div>
</div>

<p>He is therefore one of the few English poets
(alone in this respect among the greatest) who
have not sung of Love. His only English love-poem,
<span class="pb" id="pg_31">[31]</span>
the sonnet <i>To the Nightingale</i>, is his earliest
and poorest sonnet. He elected in his later poems
to sing of Marriage, its foundation in reason, its
utility, its respectability and antiquity as an institution,
and, above all, its amazing dangers. He
has thus lost the devotion of the young, who, while
they read poetry by the ear and eye for its sonorous
suggestions, and its processions of vague shapes,
love Milton; but when they come to read it for
its matter and sentiment, leave him--in most cases
never to return. The atmosphere of his later
poems is that of some great public institution.
Heaven is an Oriental despotism. Hell is a
Secession parliament. In the happy garden itself
there is no privacy, no individualism; it is the
focus of the action, the central point of the attack
and the defence; and a great part of the conversation
of its inhabitants turns on the regulations
under which they live. They never forget that
they are all mankind, and when their psalm goes
up in grateful adoration to their Creator, it is like
the unanimous voice of all nations and kindreds
and people and tongues.</p>

<p>"The plan of <i>Paradise Lost</i>" says Johnson,
"has this inconvenience, that it comprises neither
human actions nor human manners. The man
and woman who act and suffer are in a state which
no other man and woman can ever know. The
reader finds no transaction in which he can be
<span class="pb" id="pg_32">[32]</span>
engaged; beholds no condition in which he can by
any effort of imagination place himself; he has,
therefore, little natural curiosity and sympathy."
Milton, he goes on to explain, "knew human
nature only in the gross, and had never studied
the shades of character, nor the combinations
of concurring or the perplexity of contending
passions."</p>

<p>He knew human nature only in the gross. He
treated nothing less momentous than the fortunes
of the race. It is precisely from this cause that
the incomparable grandeur of Milton's characters
and situations springs. The conversations that he
records are like international parleyings. Eve is
the official Mother of mankind. Adam walks
forth to meet the angel, in ambassadorial dignity,
the accredited representative of the human race--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t4">Without more train</div>
<div class="t0">Accompanied than with his own complete</div>
<div class="t0">Perfections; in himself was all his state,</div>
<div class="t0">More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits</div>
<div class="t0">On princes, when their rich retinue long</div>
<div class="t0">Of horses led and grooms besmeared with gold</div>
<div class="t0">Dazzles the crowd and sets them all agape.</div>
</div>

<p>And if the other characters of <i>Paradise Lost</i> have
this generic stamp, it is because the chief character
of all has it--the character of the poet himself. It
lends a strange dignity to the story of Milton's
life that in all his doings he felt himself to be a
<span class="pb" id="pg_33">[33]</span>
"cause," an agent of mighty purposes. This it is
that more than excuses, it glorifies, his repeated
magniloquent allusions to himself throughout the
prose works. Holding himself on trust or on
commission, he must needs report himself, not only
to his great Taskmaster, but also from time to
time to men, his expectant and impatient beneficiaries.
Even in <i>Lycidas</i> he is thinking of
himself as much as of his dead companion--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">So may some gentle Muse</div>
<div class="t0">With lucky words favour <i>my</i> destined urn,</div>
<div class="t0">And as he passes turn,</div>
<div class="t0">And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud.</div>
</div>

<p>What if he die young himself? Are his dreams
and hopes for his own future an illusion?
He agonises with the question in the famous
digression on poetry and poetic fame. But he
consoles himself by appeal to a Court where the
success and the fame of this world are as straw in
the furnace; and then, having duly performed the
obsequies of his friend, with reinvigorated heart
he turns once more to the future--"To-morrow
to fresh woods and pastures new." A singular
ending, no doubt, to an elegy! But it is blind
and hasty to conclude that therefore the precedent
laments are "not to be considered as the effusion
of real passion." A soldier's burial is not the less
honoured because his comrades must turn from
<span class="pb" id="pg_34">[34]</span>
his grave to give their thought and strength and
courage to the cause which was also his. The
maimed rites, interrupted by the trumpet calling
to action, are a loftier commemoration than the
desolating laments of those who "weep the more
because they weep in vain." And in this way
Milton's fierce tirade against the Church hirelings,
and his preoccupation with his own ambitions
support and explain each other, and find a fit place
in the poem. He is looking to his equipment, if
perchance he may live to do that in poetry and
politics, which Edward King had died leaving
unaccomplished. When his own time came he
desired to be lamented in no other way--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Come, come; no time for lamentation now,</div>
<div class="t0">Nor much more cause. Samson hath quit himself</div>
<div class="t0">Like Samson, and heroicly hath finished</div>
<div class="t0">A life heroic, on his enemies</div>
<div class="t0">Fully revenged.</div>
</div>

<p>This overmastering sense of the cause breathes
through all his numerous references to himself.
He stands in the Forum,</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t2">Disturbed, yet comely, and in act</div>
<div class="t0">Raised, as of some great matter to begin;</div>
</div>

<p>and addresses himself, as he boasts in <i>The Second
Defence of the People of England</i>, to "the whole
collective body of people, cities, states, and
councils of the wise and eminent, through the
wide expanse of anxious and listening Europe."
<span class="pb" id="pg_35">[35]</span>
Having sacrificed the use of his eyes to the service
of the commonweal, he bates not a jot of heart or
hope--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t4">What supports me, dost thou ask?</div>
<div class="t0">The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied</div>
<div class="t0">In Liberty's defence, my noble task,</div>
<div class="t0">Of which all Europe talks from side to side.</div>
</div>

<p>And while thus his fighting years are filled with
the exaltation of battle, as he plumes and lifts
himself upon the cause that is going forward, the
story of his closing years has in it much of the
pathos of a lost cause. It was remarked by
Johnson that there is in the <i>Paradise Lost</i> little
opportunity for the pathetic; only one passage,
indeed, is allowed by him to be truly deserving of
that name. But the description of the remorse
and reconcilement of Adam and Eve, which
Johnson doubtless intended, will not compare, for
moving quality, with the matchless invocation to
the Seventh Book--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged</div>
<div class="t0">To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,</div>
<div class="t0">On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues,</div>
<div class="t0">In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,</div>
<div class="t0">And solitude; yet not alone, while thou</div>
<div class="t0">Visit'st my slumbers nightly, or when Morn</div>
<div class="t0">Purples the East. Still govern thou my song,</div>
<div class="t0">Urania, and fit audience find, though few.</div>
</div>

<p>Then the noise that he had heard, in imagination
only, thirty years earlier, assails his bodily
<span class="pb" id="pg_36">[36]</span>
ears; as evening sets in, the wonted roar is up,
not in the wild woods of fancy inhabited by the
sensual magician and his crew, but in the unlighted
streets of Restoration London, as a chorus of cup-shotten
brawlers goes roaring by. The king is
enjoying his own again; and the poet, hunted
and harassed in his last retreat, raises his petition
again to the Muse whom he had invoked at the
beginning of his task,--not Clio nor her sisters,
but the spirit of heavenly power and heavenly
wisdom; his mind reverts to that story of Orpheus
which had always had so singular and personal
a fascination for him; of Orpheus, who, holding
himself aloof from the mad amorists of Thrace,
was by them torn to pieces during the orgy of the
Dionysia, and sent rolling down the torrent of the
Hebrus; and he prays to his goddess and
guardian--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">But drive far off the barbarous dissonance</div>
<div class="t0">Of Bacchus and his revellers, the race</div>
<div class="t0">Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard</div>
<div class="t0">In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears</div>
<div class="t0">To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned</div>
<div class="t0">Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend</div>
<div class="t0">Her son. So fail not thou, who thee implores;</div>
<div class="t0">For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream.</div>
</div>

<p>Disappointed of all his political hopes, living on
neglected and poor for fourteen years after the
Restoration, and dying a private citizen, passably
<span class="pb" id="pg_37">[37]</span>
obscure, Milton yet found and took a magnanimous
revenge upon his enemies. They had crippled
only his left hand in silencing the politician, but
his right hand, which had hung useless by his side
for so many years while he served the State, was
his own still, and wielded a more Olympian
weapon. In prose and politics he was a baffled
man, but in poetry and vision he found his
triumph. His ideas, which had gone a-begging
among the politicians of his time, were stripped by
him of the rags of circumstance, and cleansed of
its dust, to be enthroned where they might secure
a hearing for all time. The surprise that he prepared
for the courtiers of the Restoration world
was like Samson's revenge, in that it fell on them
from above; and, as elsewhere in the poem of
<i>Samson Agonistes</i>, Milton was thinking not very
remotely of his own case when he wrote that
jubilant semi-chorus, with the marvellous fugal
succession of figures, wherein Samson, and by
inference Milton himself, is compared to a
smouldering fire revived, to a serpent attacking a
hen-roost, to an eagle swooping on his helpless
prey, and last, his enemies now silent for ever, to
the ph&oelig;nix, self-begotten and self-perpetuating.
The Philistian nobility (or the Restoration notables)
are described, with huge scorn, as ranged along
the tiers of their theatre, like barnyard fowl
blinking on their perch, watching, not without a
<span class="pb" id="pg_38">[38]</span>
flutter of apprehension, the vain attempts made on
their safety by the reptile grovelling in the dust
below--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t2">But he, though blind of sight,</div>
<div class="t0">Despised, and thought extinguished quite,</div>
<div class="t0">With inward eyes illuminated,</div>
<div class="t0">His fiery virtue roused</div>
<div class="t0">From under ashes into sudden flame,</div>
<div class="t0">And as an evening dragon came,</div>
<div class="t0">Assailant on the perch&egrave;d roosts</div>
<div class="t0">And nests in order ranged</div>
<div class="t0">Of tame villatic fowl, but as an eagle</div>
<div class="t0">His cloudless thunder bolted on their heads.</div>
<div class="t0">So Virtue, given for lost,</div>
<div class="t0">Depressed and overthrown, as seemed,</div>
<div class="t0">Like that self-begotten bird</div>
<div class="t0">In the Arabian woods embost,</div>
<div class="t0">That no second knows nor third,</div>
<div class="t0">And lay erewhile a holocaust,</div>
<div class="t0">From out her ashy womb now teemed,</div>
<div class="t0">Revives, reflourishes, then vigorous most</div>
<div class="t0">When most unactive deemed;</div>
<div class="t0">And, though her body die, her fame survives.</div>
<div class="t0">A secular bird, ages of lives.</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_39">[39]</div>


<h2><a id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br />THE PROSE WORKS</a></h2>

<p>It is customary for the friends of Milton to approach
his prose works with a sigh of apology.
There is a deep-rooted prejudice among the English
people against a poet who concerns himself
intimately with politics. Whether this feeling has
its origin in solicitude for the poet or for the
politics is hard to determine; indeed it is pretty
generally maintained that each is detrimental to
the other. But seeing that for one man in the
modern world who cares for poets there are at
least ten who care for politics, it is safe to assume
that the poets, when they are deprived of the
franchise, are deprived rather to maintain the
purity and efficiency of politics than for the good
of their own souls. They have been compared to
birds of Paradise, which were long believed to
have no feet; and the common sense of the English
people, with a touch of the municipal logic of
Dogberry, has enacted that whereas they have no
<span class="pb" id="pg_40">[40]</span>
feet, and have moreover been proved to have no
feet, it shall be forbidden them, under the strictest
pains and penalties, to alight and walk. Their
function is to beautify the distant landscape with
the flash of wings.</p>

<p>For most men common-sense is the standard,
and immediate utility the end, whereby they judge
political questions, great and small. Now common-sense
judges only the questions that are
brought home to it by instant example; and
utility is appealed to for a verdict only amid the
dense crowd of actual conflicting interests. Neither
the one nor the other is far-sighted or imaginative.
So it comes about that the political system, in
England, at least, is built up piecemeal; it is
founded on appetites and compromises, and mortared
by immemorial habit. To explain this
process, and to transfigure it in the pure light
of imagination, was the work of the great poet-politician,
Edmund Burke. But the poet usually
goes a hastier way to work. Looking at the
whole domiciliary structure from outside, he finds
it shapeless and ugly, like an ant-heap; and
volunteers to play the architect. His design treats
the details of individual habit and happiness in
strict subordination to the desired whole. What
he wants is consistency, symmetry, dignity; and
to achieve these he is willing to make a holocaust
of human selfishnesses. He may be a deep scholar
<span class="pb" id="pg_41">[41]</span>
and thinker, but he is apt to forget one point of
ancient wisdom,--that it is the wearer of the shoe,
and not the cobbler, who best knows where the
shoe wrings him.</p>

<p>The speculations of the poet awaken no hostile
resentment so long as they are admittedly abstract.
He is at liberty to build his Republic, his City of
the Sun, his Utopia, or his New Atlantis, amid
the indifferent applause of mankind. But when
his aim becomes practical and immediate, when he
seeks to stir the heap by introducing into it the
ruthless discomfort of an idea, a million littlenesses
assail him with deadly enmity, and he is found
sorrowfully protesting his amazement:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">I did but prompt the age to quit their clogs</div>
<div class="t">By the known rules of ancient liberty,</div>
<div class="t">When straight a barbarous noise environs me</div>
<div class="t0">Of owls and cuckoos, asses, apes, and dogs.</div>
</div>

<p>So he is brought, with great reluctance, to the
estimate of men which is expressed by Milton
in <i>The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates</i>; "being
slaves within doors, no wonder that they strive so
much to have the public state conformably
governed to the inward vicious rule whereby they
govern themselves. For indeed none can love
freedom heartily but good men."</p>

<p>Milton cannot claim the exemption from
censure which is allowed to the theorists, the
<span class="pb" id="pg_42">[42]</span>
builders of ideal states somewhere in the clouds.
On his own behalf he expressly disclaims any such
intention. "To sequester out of the world," he
says, "into Atlantic and Utopian politics, which
never can be drawn into use, will not mend our
condition; but to ordain wisely as in this world of
evil, in the midst whereof God has placed us unavoidably."
Poetry might well have served him,
if his object had been to add another to imaginary
commonwealths. He took up with politics because
he believed that in the disorder of the times his
ideas might be made a "programme," and carried
into effect.</p>

<p>It was in 1641, when already "the vigour of
the Parliament had begun to humble the pride of
the bishops," that he first intervened. "I saw,"
he says, "that a way was opening for the establishment
of real liberty; that the foundation was
laying for the deliverance of mankind from the
yoke of slavery and superstition.... I perceived
that if I ever wished to be of use, I ought at least
not to be wanting to my country, to the church,
and to so many of my fellow-Christians, in a crisis
of so much danger; I therefore determined to
relinquish the other pursuits in which I was engaged,
and to transfer the whole force of my
talents and my industry to this one important
object." So he wrote the treatise in two books,
<i>Of Reformation in England, and the causes that
<span class="pb" id="pg_43">[43]</span>
hitherto have hindered it.</i> His later pamphlets are
all similarly occasional in nature, written with a
particular and definite object in view. In these
he advocates as practicable and much-needed reforms,
among other things, the establishment of a
perpetual republic on the lines of an oligarchy; the
abolition of bishops, religious ceremonials, liturgies,
tithes, and, indeed, of all regular payment or salary
given to ministers of religion; the supersession of
universities and public schools by the erection of
new academic institutions, combining the functions
of both, "in every City throughout this Land";
the legalisation of free divorce; and the repeal of
the ordinances compelling all books to be licensed.
If he did not advocate, in any of the works put
forth during his lifetime, the legal toleration of
polygamy, it was probably only because he perceived
that that, at least, did not fall within the
scope of practical politics. He defends it in his
posthumous treatise, <i>De Doctrin&acirc; Christian&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p>It will readily be seen that on almost all these
questions Milton was not only--to use the foolish
modern phrase--"in advance of his time," but
also considerably in advance of ours. Twenty
years after his death the Licensing Acts were
abolished; for the rest, his reforms are yet to
accomplish. It is an odd remark of one of his
learned biographers that the <i>Areopagitica</i> is the
only one of all Milton's prose writings "whose
<span class="pb" id="pg_44">[44]</span>
topic is not obsolete." It is the only one of his
prose writings whose thesis commands the general
assent of modern readers, and is, therefore, from
his own practical point of view, obsolete.</p>

<p>The mere enumeration of his opinions suffices
to show that Milton's is a sad case of the poet in
politics. The labours of the twenty prime years
of his manhood have been copiously bewailed. To
have Pegasus in harness is bad enough; but when
the waggon that he draws is immovably stuck in
the mud, and he himself bespattered by his efforts,
the spectacle is yet more pitiable. Many of his
critics have expressed regret that he did not make
for himself an artificial seclusion, and continue
his purely poetical labours, with the classics for
companions. The questions that drew him into
politics were burning questions, it is true; but
were there not others to deal with them, good,
earnest, sensible, homely people? Samuel Butler
has enumerated some of those who were dedicating
their time and thought to politics at this
important crisis:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">The oyster-women locked their fish up,</div>
<div class="t0">And trudged away to cry "No Bishop":</div>
<div class="t0">The mouse-trap men laid save-alls by,</div>
<div class="t0">And 'gainst ev'l counsellors did cry;</div>
<div class="t0">Botchers left old cloaths in the lurch,</div>
<div class="t0">And fell to turn and patch the Church;</div>
<div class="t0">Some cried the Covenant, instead</div>
<div class="t0">Of pudding-pies and ginger-bread,</div>
<span class="pb" id="pg_45">[45]</span>
<div class="t0">And some for brooms, old boots and shoes,</div>
<div class="t0">Bawled out to purge the Common-house:</div>
<div class="t0">Instead of kitchen-stuff, some cry</div>
<div class="t0">A gospel-preaching ministry;</div>
<div class="t0">And some for old shirts, coats or cloak,</div>
<div class="t0">No surplices nor service-book;</div>
<div class="t0">A strange harmonious inclination</div>
<div class="t0">Of all degrees to reformation.</div>
</div>

<p>But what was Milton doing in this malodorous
and noisy assembly? Might he not with all confidence
have left the Church to the oyster-women,
and the State to the mouse-trap men? The
company that he kept with them ruined his
manners; he had to speak loud in order to be
heard, to speak broad in order to be respected;
and so (bitterest thought of all!) he lost something
of that sweet reasonableness which is a poet's
proper grace.</p>

<p>The answer to this strain of criticism is to be
found in the study of Milton's works, poetry and
prose--and perhaps best in the poetry. We could
not have had anything at all like <i>Paradise Lost</i>
from a dainty, shy poet-scholar; nor anything
half so great. The greatest men hold their power
on this tenure, that they shall not husband it
because the occasion that presents itself, although
worthy of high effort, is not answerable to the refinement
of their tastes. Milton, it is too often
forgotten, was an Englishman. He held the
privilege and the trust not cheap. When God
<span class="pb" id="pg_46">[46]</span>
intends some new and great epoch in human history,
"what does he then," this poet exultantly asks,
"but reveal himself to his servants, and, as his
manner is, first to his Englishmen?" To his
chief work in poetry he was instigated by patriotic
motives. "I applied myself," he says, "to that
resolution which Ariosto followed against the
persuasions of Bembo, to fix all the industry and
art I could unite to the adorning of my native
tongue, not to make verbal curiosity the end (that
were a toilsome vanity), but to be an interpreter
and relater of the best and sagest things among
mine own citizens throughout this island in the
mother dialect."</p>

<p>There is plenty of "verbal curiosity" in
Milton's poetry; he is in some respects the finest
craftsman who ever handled the English speech:
so that this declaration is the more timely to remind
us by how wide a chasm he is separated from those
modern greenhouse poets who move contentedly
in an atmosphere of art ideals and art theories.
He had his breeding from the ancient world,
where &AElig;schylus fought at Marathon, and he could
not think of politics as of a separable part of
human life.</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,</div>
<div class="t0">Or with the tangles of Ne&aelig;ra's hair,</div>
</div>

<p>is a lyric ideal that may quite well consist with
<span class="pb" id="pg_47">[47]</span>
political indifference, but how should an epic inspiration
be nourished where the prosperity of the
State is lightly esteemed? Even had poetry lost
by his political adventures, he would have been
content that politics should gain. And politics
did gain; for Milton's prose works raise every
question they touch, even where they cannot truly
be said to advance it. It is as unseemly for the
politicians to complain of his choice, as it would
be for the herdsmen of King Admetus to complain
of the presence among them of a god. The
large considerations and high passions imported
into the treatment of practical questions by a
Milton, or a Burke, have done much to keep
even party politics at a high level in England, so
that civil servants and journalists may join in the
hymn of the herdsmen--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">He has been our fellow, the morning of our days,</div>
<div class="t0">Us he chose for house-mates, and this way went.</div>
<div class="t4">God, of whom music</div>
<div class="t4">And song and blood are pure,</div>
<div class="t4">The day is never darkened</div>
<div class="t4">That had thee here obscure!</div>
</div>

<p>In a long autobiographic passage in the <i>Second
Defence of the People of England</i> Milton makes a
formal classification of his prose works written
before that date. All of them, he says, were
designed to promote Liberty. By the accidents
of the time he was induced to treat first, in his
<span class="pb" id="pg_48">[48]</span>
anti-episcopal pamphlets, of religious liberty.
Once that controversy was fairly ablaze, in the
name of the same goddess he applied his incendiary
torch to humbler piles. "I perceived," he says,
"that there were three species of liberty which are
essential to the happiness of social life--religious,
domestic, and civil; and as I had already written
concerning the first, and the magistrates were
strenuously active in obtaining the third, I determined
to turn my attention to the second, or the
domestic species." He includes in this division of
his work the Divorce pamphlets, the tractate
<i>Of Education</i>, and the <i>Areopagitica</i>, as dealing with
the "three material questions" (so he calls them)
of domestic liberty, namely, "the conditions of the
conjugal tie, the education of the children, and the
free publication of the thoughts."</p>

<p>It seems a strange conception of domestic
liberty which makes it rest on a threefold support--divorce
at will, an unrestrained printing-press,
and the encyclop&aelig;dic education of polyglot
children. But the truth is that Milton's classification
is an after-thought. The pamphlets that
he names were all written by him much about the
same time, between 1643 and 1645; but the true
history of their origin is more interesting and less
symmetrical than the later invented scheme of
classification. The Divorce pamphlets were
written because Milton was unhappily married.
<span class="pb" id="pg_49">[49]</span>
The <i>Areopagitica</i> was written because his heterodox
views concerning marriage had brought him into
collision with the Presbyterian censors of the press.
His treatise on education was written because he
had undertaken the education of his own nephews,
and had become deeply interested in that question.
In all three his own experience is the first motive;
in all three that experience is concealed beneath a
formidable array of general considerations, dogmatically
propounded.</p>

<p>The case is the same with regard to the
pamphlets that treat of religious and civil liberty;
they are not only occasional, but intensely personal,
even in their origins. The earliest of them, the
five ecclesiastical pamphlets of the year 1641, deal
with a question which had been of intimate concern
to Milton ever since the beginning of his Cambridge
days. The celebrated controversy with
Salmasius and his abettors, concerning the death of
King Charles, is a gladiatorial combat from which
every element save the personal is often absent.
In these bouts offensive biography and defensive
autobiography serve for sword and shield. This
personal character of the prose writings, while it
has repelled some readers interested mainly in the
questions discussed, has attracted others who are
interested chiefly in the writer. A rich harvest of
personal allusion has been gathered from the controversial
treatises, and perhaps, even now, the
<span class="pb" id="pg_50">[50]</span>
field has not been gleaned to the last ear. It
is worthy of remark, for instance, how Milton's
pre-occupation with the themes which he had
already pondered, and turned this way and that in
his mind, to test their fitness for a monumental
work, shows itself in his choice of figure and
allusion. Attention has often been called to the
elaborate comparison, founded on the history of
Samson, in <i>The Reason of Church Government
urged against Prelaty</i>:--</p>

<p>"I cannot better liken the state and person of
a king than to that mighty Nazarite Samson; who
being disciplined from his birth in the precepts
and the practice of temperance and sobriety,
without the strong drink of injurious and excessive
desires, grows up to a noble strength and
perfection with those his illustrious and sunny locks,
the laws, waving and curling about his god-like
shoulders. And while he keeps them about
him undiminished and unshorn, he may with the
jawbone of an ass, that is, with the word of his
meanest officer, suppress and put to confusion
thousands of those that rise against his just power.
But laying down his head among the strumpet flatteries
of prelates, while he sleeps and thinks no
harm, they, wickedly shaving off all those bright and
weighty tresses of his law, and just prerogatives,
which were his ornament and strength, deliver him
over to indirect and violent counsels, which, as those
<span class="pb" id="pg_51">[51]</span>
Philistines, put out the fair and far-sighted eyes of
his natural discerning, and make him grind in the
prison-house of their sinister ends and practices
upon him: till he, knowing this prelatical rasor to
have bereft him of his wonted might, nourish
again his puissant hair, the golden beams of law
and right; and they, sternly shook, thunder with
ruin upon the heads of those his evil counsellors,
but not without great affliction to himself."</p>

<p>This ingenious allegorical application naturally
finds no place in the grave poem of Milton's
latest years. And yet, in one passage at least,
his earlier love for the high-figured style took
him captive again. The strong drink from which
the Samson of the play abstains is strong drink,
not "injurious and excessive desires." There is
no hint of prelatical conspiracy in the enticements
of Dalila. But perhaps some faint reminiscence of
his earlier fable concerning Samson's hair recurred
to Milton's mind when he gave to Manoa a
speech comparing the locks of the hero to the
strength, not of the law, but of a nation in arms:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">And I persuade me God had not permitted</div>
<div class="t0">His strength again to grow up with his hair,</div>
<div class="t0">Garrisoned round about him like a camp</div>
<div class="t0">Of faithful soldiery, were not his purpose</div>
<div class="t0">To use him further yet in some great service.</div>
</div>

<p>The theme of <i>Samson Agonistes</i> had thus already
taken possession of Milton's imagination when he
<span class="pb" id="pg_52">[52]</span>
wrote his first prose tractates. But the same
writings furnish even stronger evidence of his
early dallyings with the theme of <i>Paradise Lost</i>.
"It was from out the rind of one apple tasted," he
says in the <i>Areopagitica</i>, "that the knowledge of
good and evil, as two twins cleaving together,
leaped forth into the world." And again, in
<i>The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</i>:--"The
academics and stoics ... knew not what a consummate
and most adorned Pandora was bestowed
upon Adam, to be the nurse and guide of his
arbitrary happiness and perseverance, I mean, his
native innocence and perfection, which might have
kept him from being our true Epimetheus."
Some of these references show the imaginative
scheme of the <i>Paradise Lost</i> in the process of
building. In one passage, for instance, of the last
quoted treatise, Milton expounds the pagan belief
that God punishes his enemies most when he
throws them furthest from him:--"Which then
they held he did, when he blinded, hardened, and
stirred up his offenders, to finish and pile up their
desperate work since they had undertaken it. To
banish for ever into a local hell, whether in the
air or in the centre, or in that uttermost and
bottomless gulf of chaos, deeper from holy bliss
than the world's diameter multiplied, they thought
not a punishing so proper and proportionate for
God to inflict as to punish sin with sin." It
<span class="pb" id="pg_53">[53]</span>
would seem as if the poet had not as yet fixed the
situation of his local hell, but remained suspended
between rival theories. The other idea, of the
Divine permission and impulse given to hardened
sinners, finds a conspicuous place in the poem. In
one instance, at least, a figure drawn from the
story of the Creation is violently handled to serve
strange uses. The evolution of the four elements
from the chaotic welter of hot, cold, moist, and
dry, is adduced as a proof that the laws of God
and of nature approve free divorce:--"By his
divorcing command the world first rose out of
chaos, nor can be renewed again out of confusion,
but by the separating of unmeet consorts."</p>

<p>Allusions of this kind occur most frequently in
the earlier prose writings, while the studies that
had been interrupted by controversy were yet fresh
in Milton's memory. They would hardly be
worth the quotation, were it not that they are
another evidence of the transparency of his mind.
In looking through his prose works you see traces
of all that was engaging his imagination and
thought at the time. Poetry is the highest of expressive
arts; and poets are the worst dissemblers
or economisers of truth in the world. Their
knowledge, like their feeling, possesses them, and
must find expression as argument, or illustration,
or figure, whatever the immediate matter in hand.
The prose works of Milton are thus, from first to
<span class="pb" id="pg_54">[54]</span>
last, an exposition of himself. The divorce
pamphlets, especially, are hot with smothered
personal feeling. Long years afterwards, when
time and change had softened and blurred it in
memory, his early misadventure was reflected in
more than one passage of the later poems. The
humble plaint of Eve, and the description of her
reunion with her alienated lord, in the Tenth Book
of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, doubtless contains, as has often
been said, some reflection of what took place at a
similar interview in 1645, when Mistress Mary
Milton returned to her offended husband. That
one principal cause of the rupture has been rightly
divined, by Mr. Mark Pattison and others, is
probable from certain remarkable lines in the
Eighth Book, where Adam describes how he was
presented with his bride:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t10">On she came,</div>
<div class="t0">Led by her Heavenly Maker, though unseen,</div>
<div class="t0">And guided by his voice, nor uninformed</div>
<div class="t0">Of nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites.</div>
</div>

<p>Even at so wide a remove of time, the poet's
wounded pride finds expression in this singular
theory--or, rather, in this more than dubious piece
of self-justification.</p>

<p>But although the hurt he had suffered, in his
most susceptible feelings, gives eloquence and
plangency to his divorce pamphlets, it was not
merely to voice his sufferings that he wrote those
<span class="pb" id="pg_55">[55]</span>
pamphlets. Most men in Milton's position,
married to "a nothing, a desertrice, an adversary,"
would have recognised that theirs was one of those
exceptional cases for which the law cannot provide,
and would have sat down under their unhappy
chance, to bear it or mitigate it as best they
might. Some poets of the time of the Romantic
Revival would have claimed the privilege of genius
to be a law unto itself; the law of the State being
designed for the common rout, whose lesser
sensibilities and weaker individuality make them
amenable to its discipline. Milton did neither
the one thing nor the other. The modern
idolatry of genius was as yet uninvented; he was
a citizen first, a poet and an unhappy man afterwards.
He directed his energies to proving, not
that he should be exempted from the operation of
the law, but that the law itself should be changed.
He had entered into marriage, with full ceremonial
ushering, by the main door; he would go out the
same way, or not at all. Thus even in this most
personal matter he pleads, not for himself, but for
the commonweal. He cannot conceive of happiness
as of a private possession, to be secretly
enjoyed; it stands rooted, like justice, in the wise
and equal ordinances of the State; and the only
freedom that he values is freedom under the law.</p>

<p>Like the citizen of some antique state, he discourses
of marriage in the market-place. In his
<span class="pb" id="pg_56">[56]</span>
efforts to be persuasive, both here and in the
<i>Areopagitica</i>, he humbles himself to management
and the seasonings of flattery. It is a new trade
for him, and suits oddly with his pride. But he
hoped much, at this time, from the Parliament,
that "select assembly," containing so many
"worthy senators" and "Christian reformers,"
"judges and lawgivers." In the enthusiasm of
his hopes, he credits them with a desire "to
imitate the old and elegant humanity of Greece,"
with a wisdom greater than that of the Athenian
Parliament, with a magnanimous willingness to
repeal their own acts at the dictate of the voice of
reason. And all this at a time when the Presbyterians
were in the ascendant, intent upon establishing
a discipline neither old, nor elegant, nor
humane, so little acquainted with Greece, that it
was one of Selden's amusements to confute their
divines by citing a reading from the Greek
Testament. Milton was destined to grievous
disappointment, and his rage against the Presbyterians,
in some of his later pamphlets, was the
fiercer.</p>

<p>But although his pamphlets are both occasional
and personal, and even address themselves at times
to conciliation and persuasion, the views that they
advocate and the system of thought that underlies
them were not the products of time and
accident. Milton was an idealist, pure and simple,
<span class="pb" id="pg_57">[57]</span>
in politics. Had he lived under the Tudor
sovereigns, he would have been reduced, with Sir
Thomas More, Montaigne, and John Barclay, the
author of <i>Argenis</i>, to express himself by way of
romance and allegory. It was his fortune to live
at a time when the Tudor state system was breaking
up with appalling suddenness, and along with it the
Tudor compromise in the affairs of the Church,
imposed from above upon an unawakened people,
was falling into wreckage. Here was an opportunity
that has not often, in the world's history,
come to a poet, of realising the dream that he
had dreamed in his study, of setting up again, for
the admiration and comfort of posterity, the model
of an ancient Republic.</p>

<p>The best of all Milton's critics has left us the
worst account of his political opinions. Johnson's
censure of <i>Lycidas</i>, much as it has been ridiculed
and decried, is judicious and discerning compared
with his explanation of Milton's political creed:--"Milton's
republicanism was, I am afraid, founded
in an envious hatred of greatness, and a sullen
desire of independence, in petulance impatient of
control, and pride disdainful of superiority. He
hated monarchs in the State, and prelates in the
Church; for he hated all whom he was required to
obey. It is to be suspected that his predominant
desire was to destroy, rather than establish, and
that he felt not so much the love of liberty as
<span class="pb" id="pg_58">[58]</span>
repugnance to authority." It may, at least, be
credited to Johnson for moderation, that he requires
only four of the Seven Deadly Sins, to wit,
Pride, Envy, Anger, and Sloth, to explain Milton's
political tenets. Had he permitted himself
another sentence, an easy place might surely have
been made for Gluttony, Luxury, and Covetousness,
the three whose absence cannot fail to be
remarked by any lover of thorough and detailed
treatment in these intricate problems of human
character.</p>

<p>If, in our more modern fashion, we seek for the
origin of Milton's ideas in his education, his habits
of thought, and his admirations, we shall be
obliged to admit that they are all rooted in his
conception of the ancient City State. It was the
wish of Thomas Hobbes to abolish the study of
Greek and Latin in our schools and colleges,
because this study fosters a love of freedom, and
unfits men to be the subjects of an absolute
monarch. His happiest illustration would have
been the case of his contemporary, Milton. Yet in
all Milton's writings there is no trace of the modern
democratic doctrine of equality. A hearing is all
that he claims. So far from hating greatness, he
carries his admiration for it, for personal virtue and
prowess, almost to excess. The poet who described
the infernal conclave in the Second Book of
<i>Paradise Lost</i> was not likely to be insensible to the
<span class="pb" id="pg_59">[59]</span>
part played in politics by men of eminent and
dominating personality. To think of free government
as of an engine for depressing unusual merit
was impossible for Milton. He lived in an age
that had found in Plutarch's men its highest ideals
of political character. Never, since their own day,
had the "noble Grecians and Romans" exercised so
irresistible a fascination on the minds of men, or so
real an influence on the affairs of the State, as was
theirs at the time of the Renaissance. The mist in
which they had long been enveloped was swept
away, and these colossal figures of soldiers, patriots,
and counsellors loomed large and clear across the
ages, their majesty enhanced by distance and by
art, which conspire to efface all that is accidental,
petty, and distracting. We cannot see these
figures as they appeared to the Renaissance world.
One of the chief results of modern historical labour
and research has been that it has peopled the
Middle Ages for us, and interposed a whole society
of living men, our ancestors, between us and
ancient Rome. But in Milton's time this process
was only beginning; the collections and researches
that made it possible were largely the work of his
contemporaries,--and were despised by him.
When he looked back on the world's history, from
his own standpoint, he saw, near at hand and
stretching away into the distance, a desert, from
which a black mass of cloud had just been lifted;
<span class="pb" id="pg_60">[60]</span>
and, across the desert, lying fair under the broad
sunshine, a city--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">With gilded battlements, conspicuous far,</div>
<div class="t0">Turrets and terrasses, and glittering spires.</div>
</div>

<p>It was towards this ancient civic life, with its
arts and arms and long renown, that he reached
forth passionate hands of yearning. The intervening
tract, whither his younger feet had wandered,
almost ceased to exist for him; the paladins and
ladies of medi&aelig;val story were the deceitful mirage
of the desert; the true life of antiquity lay beyond.
In all his allusions to the great themes of romance
two things are noticeable: first, how deeply his
imagination had been stirred by them, so that they
are used as a last crown of decoration in some of
the most exalted passages of his great poems; and
next, how careful he is to stamp them as fiction.
His studies for the early <i>History of Britain</i> had
cloyed him with legends conveyed from book to
book. Once convinced that no certain historical
ground could be found for the feet among the
whole mass of these traditions, Milton ceased to
regard them as eligible subjects for his greatest
poem. But their beauty dwelt with him; the
memory of the embattled chivalry of Arthur and
Charlemagne recurs to him when he is seeking for
the topmost reach of human power and splendour
that he may belittle it by the side of Satan's rebel
<span class="pb" id="pg_61">[61]</span>
host; and the specious handmaidens who served
the Tempter's phantom banquet in the desert are
described as lovely beyond what has been</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t8">Fabled since</div>
<div class="t0">Of fairy damsels met in forest wide</div>
<div class="t0">By Knights of Logres, or of Lyones,</div>
<div class="t0">Lancelot, or Pelleas, or Pellenore.</div>
</div>

<p>If Milton's attitude to medi&aelig;val romance is one
of regretful suspicion, his attitude to the greatest of
medi&aelig;val institutions is one of bitter contempt.
He inveighs even against the "antiquitarians,"
such as Camden, who, he says, "cannot but love
bishops as well as old coins and his much lamented
monasteries, for antiquity's sake." For near
twelve hundred years these same bishops "have
been in England to our souls a sad and doleful
succession of illiterate and blind guides." It is
needless to multiply extracts illustrative of Milton's
opinions on the Church; behind the enormous
wealth of rhetoric and invective poured forth in
his pamphlets, the opinions that he holds are few
and simple. When he had been disappointed by
the Presbyterians, and had finally turned from them,
his beliefs inclined more and more, in two points
at least, to the tenets of the newly arisen sect of
Quakers--to a pure spiritualism in religion, and
the complete separation of Church and State.
Their horror of war he never shared. The model
of the Church he sought in the earliest records of
<span class="pb" id="pg_62">[62]</span>
Christianity, and less and less even there; the
model of the State in the ancient republics. All
subsequent experience and precedent was to him a
hindrance and a mischief. So rapidly and easily
does his mind leap from the ancient to the modern
world, that even when he speaks of his love for the
drama, as in his first Latin elegy or in <i>Il Penseroso</i>,
it is sometimes difficult to say whether he is thinking
of the Elizabethan or of the Attic dramatists.</p>

<p>The lodestar of his hopes is liberty, his main
end the establishment of "a free commonwealth."
He knows as well as Montesquieu that democracy
in its pristine dignity can be erected only on a
wide foundation of public virtue. "To govern
well," he declares in the treatise <i>Of Reformation
in England</i>, "is to train up a nation in true
wisdom and virtue, and that which springs from
thence, magnanimity (take heed of that), and
that which is our beginning, regeneration, and
happiest end, likeness to God, which in one word
we call godliness;... other things follow as the
shadow does the substance." In the same pamphlet
this envious hater of greatness remarks that
"to govern a nation piously and justly, which
only is to say happily, is for a spirit of the greatest
size, and divinest mettle." And men worthy of
this description had, as it seemed to him, arisen
in his own time. His praise of Cromwell and the
leaders associated with him is almost extravagant
<span class="pb" id="pg_63">[63]</span>
in its enthusiasm. "While you, O Cromwell, are
left among us, he hardly shows a proper confidence
in the Supreme, who distrusts the security of
England, when he sees that you are in so special
a manner the favoured object of the Divine regard."
His mind is full of the achievements of
Cyrus, Epaminondas, and Scipio; he denies to
the Protector no honour that may be drawn from
these high comparisons. And then, as in <i>Lycidas</i>,
so also in <i>The Second Defence of the People of
England</i>, Milton concludes his celebration of
another by a return to himself and his pride in
a duty fulfilled. Opportunity, he declares, is
offered for great achievements; if it be not
seized, posterity will judge "that men only
were wanting for the execution; while they were
not wanting who could rightly counsel, exhort,
inspire, and bind an unfading wreath of praise
round the brows of the illustrious actors in so
glorious a scene."</p>

<p>In the measures that he recommends to Cromwell
as necessary for the public welfare, his mistakes
are the generous errors of an idealist. He
writes as if all were either Cromwells or Miltons,
and worthy of the fullest measure of liberty.
"Now the time seems come," he exclaims,
"wherein Moses, the great prophet, may sit in
heaven rejoicing to see that memorable and
glorious wish of his fulfilled, when not only our
<span class="pb" id="pg_64">[64]</span>
seventy elders, but all the Lord's people, are
become prophets." His general propositions on
the function of law are unimpeachable. "He
who wisely would restrain the reasonable soul of
man within due bounds, must first himself know
perfectly how far the territory and dominion
extends of just and honest liberty. As little must
he offer to bind that which God hath loosened
as to loosen that which He hath bound. The
ignorance and mistake of this high point hath
heaped up one huge half of all the misery that
hath been since Adam." But with the application
to issues of the day it appears that the mistake has
been all one way. "Laws are usually worse in
proportion as they are more numerous." The
free spirit of man can govern him without "a
garrison upon his neck of empty and over-dignified
precepts."</p>

<p>Whether he treat of religion, of education, of
divorce, or of civil government, the error is always
the same, a confidence too absolute in the capacity
and integrity of the reasonable soul of man. A
liturgy, for example, is intolerable, because it is a
slur upon the extemporary effusions of ministers
of the Gospel. "Well may men of eminent gifts
set forth as many forms and helps to prayer as
they please; but to impose them on ministers
lawfully called and sufficiently tried ... is a supercilious
tyranny, impropriating the Spirit of God to
<span class="pb" id="pg_65">[65]</span>
themselves." Milton, we know, did not habitually
attend public worship at any of the conventicles
of the sectaries, or perhaps he might have found
reason to modify this censure.</p>

<p>Some of his impassioned pleadings were possibly
not wholly without effect on the politics of the
time. It is interesting, at any rate, to find Cromwell,
in his letter written in 1650 to the Governor
of Edinburgh Castle, adopting one of the main
arguments of the <i>Areopagitica</i>, and enforcing it
against the Presbyterians by a figure which may
have been borrowed from that tract. "Your
pretended fear," he writes, "lest error should step
in, is like the man who would keep all wine out of
the country lest men should be drunk. It will be
found an unjust and unwise jealousy to deprive a
man of his natural liberty upon a supposition that
he may abuse it. When he doth abuse it, judge."
But Cromwell never applied his logic to the
removal of the restraint upon printing, which by
this same argument Milton had judged to be
"the greatest displeasure and indignity to a free
and knowing spirit that can be put upon him."
He was too practical a statesman to be frightened
into logic by a little paper shot.</p>

<p>Logical Milton always was. He learned little
or nothing from the political events of his time.
He was throughout consistent with himself;
prepared to take any risks that his advocacy
<span class="pb" id="pg_66">[66]</span>
might bring upon him, not prepared to forego
or modify his opinions because of human incompetence
or human imbecility. Between the
consistent and unflinching Royalists on the one
hand, and the consistent and unflinching Republicans
on the other, the most of the population
of England wavered and hung. But half-measures
and half-heartedness were alike unintelligible to
Milton. He fell upon the Presbyterians when
they showed a disposition to palter with the
logical consequences of their own action, and
scourged them unmercifully. They had "banded
and borne arms against their king, divested him,
disanointed him, nay, cursed him all over in their
pulpits, and their pamphlets." But when once
the king was brought to trial, then "he who but
erewhile in the pulpits was a cursed tyrant, an
enemy to God and saints, laden with all the
innocent blood spilt in three kingdoms, and so to
be fought against, is now, though nothing penitent
or altered from his first principles, a lawful
magistrate, a sovereign lord, the Lord's anointed,
not to be touched, though by themselves imprisoned."
He prepares for them a similar
dilemma, between the horns of which they have
since been content to dwell, in his treatment of the
question of divorce: "They dare not affirm that
marriage is either a sacrament or a mystery ... and
yet they invest it with such an awful sanctity,
<span class="pb" id="pg_67">[67]</span>
and give it such adamantine chains to bind with,
as if it were to be worshipped like some Indian
deity, when it can confer no blessing upon us,
but works more and more to our misery."</p>

<p>Milton's astonishment and indignation in cases
like these are a convincing evidence of his inability
to understand average politics, and that
world of convenience, precaution, and compromise
which is their native place. His own tenacity
and constancy have something grim about them.
Andrew Marvell, in his tract called <i>The Rehearsal
Transposed</i>, speaking of the intolerance of his
adversary, Samuel Parker, says: "If you have a
mind to die, or to be of his party (there are
but these two conditions), you may perhaps be
rendered capable of his charity." Neither of
these two conditions was a certain title to the
charity of Milton. In the <i>Eikonoklastes</i> he pursues
the dead king with jibe and taunt, and exults
over the smallest advantage gained. The opening
words of the tract show him conscious of the
difficulty and delicacy of the part he acted in
making war on one who had "paid his final
debt to nature and his faults." But what then?
If the king, being dead, could speak, the dead
king must be answered, and his gauntlet taken
up "in the behalf of liberty and the commonwealth."</p>

<p>The manner in which he conducts this and
<span class="pb" id="pg_68">[68]</span>
other controversies has brought upon Milton's
head universal reproach. He is intemperate and
violent, he heaps up personal scurrilities against
his adversaries, and triumphs in their misfortunes.
There is nothing wherein our age more differs
from his than in the accepted rules governing
controversy, and he has lost estimation accordingly.
Yet not a few critics, it may be suspected, have
allowed their dislike of the thing he says to hurry
them into an exaggerated censure on his manner
of saying it. It is important, in the first place,
to remember that his violences are not the
violences of the hired rhetorician. He was
prepared to stand by what he wrote, and he
knew the risks that he ran in those shifting and
uncertain times. His life was in danger at the
Restoration, and was saved by some unknown
piece of good fortune or clemency. He was not
a coward reviler, a "tongue-doughty giant," whose
ears are the most delicate part about him, but an
open fighter, who got as good as he gave. And
then it is sometimes forgotten that the most
scurrilous of Milton's pamphlets were written in
Latin, a language which has always enjoyed an
excellent liberty in the matter of personal abuse;
while even his English pamphlets, wherein at
times he shows almost as pretty a talent in reviling,
were written for an audience inured to the habitual
amenities of Latin controversy. Sir Thomas
<span class="pb" id="pg_69">[69]</span>
More was famous for his knack of calling bad
names in good Latin, yet his posterity rise up and
call him blessed. Milton, like More, observed
the rules of the game, which allowed practices
condemned in the modern literary prize-ring.
He calls Salmasius a poor grammarian, a pragmatical
coxcomb, a silly little scholar, a mercenary
advocate, a loggerhead, a hare-brained blunderbuss,
a witless brawler, a mongrel cur; he reproaches
him with the domestic tyranny put upon
him by that barking she-wolf, his wife, and winds
up with an elaborate comparison (not wholly
unfamiliar to modern methods of controversy)
between Salmasius and Judas. With his nameless
opponent in the Divorce quarrel he deals--this
time in English--no less contemptuously: "I
mean not to dispute philosophy with this pork,
who never read any." The creature is a conspicuous
gull, an odious fool, a dolt, an idiot, a
groom, a rank pettifogger, a presumptuous losel,
a clown, a vice, a huckster-at-law, whose "jabberment
is the flashiest and the fustiest that ever
corrupted in such an unswilled hogshead." "What
should a man say more to a snout in this pickle?
What language can be low and degenerate
enough?" In the <i>Apology</i> for Smectymnuus,
Milton sets forth his own defence of his acrimony
and violence: "There may be a sanctified bitterness,"
he remarks, "against the enemies of the
<span class="pb" id="pg_70">[70]</span>
truth;" and he dares to quote the casuistry of
Electra in <i>Sophocles</i>:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">'Tis you that say it, not I. You do the deeds,</div>
<div class="t0">And your ungodly deeds find me the words.</div>
</div>

<p>The exigencies of controversy revealed in
Milton not only an inexhaustible store of coarse
invective, but also, at times, the flash of real wit.
"My fate," he says, with some sense of the incongruity
of the thing, "extorts from me a talent of
sport, which I had thought to hide in a napkin."
We are privileged to hear Milton laugh. It is
not mirthful nor gentle laughter, but rather the
fierce, harsh, vehement laughter of the Hebrew
Psalms, the laughter of scorn, the shooting out of
the lips, the saying "Ha, ha." He speaks with
his mouth, and swords are in his lips. Thus, of
Alexander Morus, Professor of Sacred History at
Amsterdam, whom he suspected to be the author
of a tract in support of Salmasius, he says: "There
is one More, part Frenchman and part Scot, so
that one country or one people cannot be quite
overwhelmed with the whole infamy of his extraction";
and he indulges himself in a debauch of
punning on <i>Morus</i>, the Latin word for a mulberry.
In the prelatical controversy, after discussing with
his opponent the meaning of the word "angel," he
continues: "It is not ordination nor jurisdiction
that is angelical, but the heavenly message of the
<span class="pb" id="pg_71">[71]</span>
Gospel, which is the office of all ministers alike....
And if you will contend still for a superiority
in one person, you must ground it better than
from this metaphor, which you may now deplore
as the axe-head that fell into the water, and say,
'Alas, master! for it was borrowed'; unless you
have as good a faculty to make iron swim, as you
had to make light froth sink." In the <i>Apology</i>
for Smectymnuus he heaps one grotesque comparison
on another. His adversary, the son of
Bishop Hall, is like "some empiric of false
accusations to try his poisons upon me, whether
they would work or not." The learning that was
displayed by the champion of Episcopacy and the
very typographical arrangement of his book incur
an equal contempt: the margin of his treatise "is
the sluice most commonly that feeds the drought
of his text.... Nor yet content with the wonted
room of his margin, but he must cut out large
docks and creeks into his text, to unlade the
foolish frigate of his unseasonable authorities."
His best folios "are predestined to no better end
than to make winding-sheets in Lent for pilchers."
With this last stroke Milton is so well pleased
that he repeats the same prediction in an elaborated
form over the works of Salmasius, and even celebrates
in numerous verse the forethought and
bounty of one who has thus taken pity on the
nakedness of fishes.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_72">[72]</div>

<p>The fantastic nature of these quips and taunts
reminds us that Milton belonged to the age of
the metaphysical poets and satirists, the age of
Cowley, and Cleveland, and Butler. His prose
works have been searched chiefly for passages that
may be used to illustrate his poetry; and although
the search has been rewarded with many natural
coincidences of expression, not a few passages of
lofty self-confidence, and some raptures of poetic
metaphor, the result has been in the main a
disappointment. His admirers, too jealous for
the poetic dignity of their hero, have turned away
sorrowfully from this memorial heap of odd-shaped
missiles, hurled from his dire left hand for
the confusion of his enemies. And yet, rightly
judged, there is instruction, and an increased
reverence for the poet, to be found in these also--in
all that wild array of subjects and methods
which he commands for the purposes of his prose,
but dismisses from the service of his verse. It
was a strict and rare selection that he made among
the auxiliaries when he addressed himself to the
more arduous attempt. Here and there, even in
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, his education in the handling of
satire and invective stood him in stead. The
poem contains more than one "flyting"--to use
the Scottish term--and the high war of words
between Satan and Abdiel in heaven, or between
Satan and Gabriel on earth, could not have been
<span class="pb" id="pg_73">[73]</span>
handled save by a master of all the weapons of
verbal fence and all the devices of wounding
invective. In the great close of the Fourth Book,
especially, where the arch-fiend and the archangel
retaliate defiance, and tower, in swift alternate
flights, to higher and higher pitches of exultant
scorn, Milton puts forth all his strength, and
brings into action a whole armoury of sarcasm and
insult whetted and polished from its earlier prosaic
exercise. Even the grotesque element in his
humour is not wholly excluded from the <i>Paradise
Lost</i>; it has full scope, for once, in the episodical
description of the Paradise of Fools--that barren
continent, beaten on by the storms of chaos, dark
save for some faint glimmerings from the wall of
heaven, the inhabitants a disordered and depraved
multitude of philosophers, crusaders, monks, and
friars, blown like leaves into the air by the winds
that sweep those desert tracts. Unlike the
Paradise that was lost, this paradise is wholly of
Milton's invention, and is the best extant monument
to that spirit of mockery and savage triumph
which is all the humour that he knows.</p>

<p>The style of his prose works is a style formed
upon oratorical models. The long winding
sentence, propped on epithets and festooned with
digressions, was the habitual vehicle of his
meaning. The effect it produces at its best was
well described by Marvell, who, in a letter to
<span class="pb" id="pg_74">[74]</span>
Milton thanking him for a copy of the <i>Defence of
the People of England</i>, remarks: "When I consider
how equally it turns and rises with so many
figures, it seems to me a Trajan's column, in
whose winding ascent we see embossed the several
monuments of your learned victories." The clink
of the rhyming couplet was not more displeasing
to Milton's ear than the continued emphatic bark
of a series of short sentences. Accustomed as he
was to the heavy-armed processional manner of
scholarly Renaissance prose, he felt it an indignity
to "lie at the mercy of a coy, flirting style; to be
girded with frumps and curtal jibes, by one who
makes sentences by the statute, as if all above
three inches long were confiscate." Later on in
the <i>Apology</i> he returns to this grievance, and
describes how his adversary "sobs me out half a
dozen phthisical mottoes, wherever he had them,
hopping short in the measure of convulsion fits;
in which labour the agony of his wit having
escaped narrowly, instead of well-sized periods, he
greets us with a quantity of thumb-ring posies."
The men of the Renaissance despised the homely
savour of the native English syntax with its rude
rhetoric and abrupt logic and its lore of popular
adages and maxims; they had learned to taste a
subtler pleasure in the progressive undulations of
a long mobile sentence, rising and falling alternately,
reaching the limit of its height towards the
<span class="pb" id="pg_75">[75]</span>
middle, and at the close either dying away or
breaking in a sudden crash of unexpected downward
emphasis. This is the sentence preferred by
Milton, and, where haste or zeal does not interfere
with the leisurely ordering, handled by him
with excellent skill. At its best and at its worst
alike his prose is the prose of a poet. His
sentences rarely conform to any strict periodic
model; each idea, as it occurs to him, brings with
it a train of variation and enrichment, which, by
the time the sentence closes, is often found in sole
possession. The architecture depends on melody
rather than on logic. The emphasis and burden
of the thought generally hangs on the epithets,
descriptive terms, and phrases, which he strengthens
by arranging them in pairs, after a fashion much
practised by poets. Thus, to take a few examples
from the Divorce pamphlets, a wife, who should be
"an intimate and speaking help," "a ready and
reviving associate," to comfort "the misinformed
and wearied life of man" with "a sweet and gladsome
society," is too often "a mute and spiritless
mate," united to her husband in "a disconsolate
and unenjoined matrimony," whereby the blessing
that was expected with her is changed "into a
familiar and coinhabiting mischief, at least into a
drooping and disconsolate household captivity,
without refuge or redemption." "The mystical
and blessed union of marriage can be no way more
<span class="pb" id="pg_76">[76]</span>
unhallowed and profaned, than by the forcible
uniting of such disunions and separations."
"And it is a less breach of wedlock to part
with wise and quiet consent betimes, than still
to foil and profane that mystery of joy and
union with a polluting sadness and perpetual
distemper."</p>

<p>The balance of epithet, the delicate music, the
sentence that resembles a chain with link added to
link rather than a hoop whose ends are welded
together by the hammer--these are the characteristics
of Milton's prose. They are illustrated
in that short passage of the <i>Areopagitica</i>, well
known to all readers of English: "I cannot
praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised
and unbreathed, that never sallies out and seeks
her adversary, but slinks out of the race, where
that immortal garland is to be run for, not without
dust and heat." Or in the striking description of
London during the Civil War: "Behold now this
vast city, a city of refuge, the mansion-house of
liberty, encompassed and surrounded with his
protection; the shop of war hath not there more
anvils and hammers working, to fashion out the
plates and instruments of armed justice in defence
of beleaguered truth, than there be pens and heads
there, sitting by their studious lamps, musing,
searching, revolving new notions and ideas wherewith
to present, as with their homage and their
<span class="pb" id="pg_77">[77]</span>
fealty, the approaching reformation; others as
fast reading, trying all things, assenting to the
force of reason and convincement."</p>

<p>This sonorous balance of phrase and epithet
cannot always escape what Milton himself calls
"the heathenish battology of multiplying words."
It serves the uses of rhetoric rather than of logic,
and by the fervour of its repetitions and enlargements
unfits his prose for the plainer purposes of
argument or exposition. His argument is sometimes
destroyed or blemished by the fire that it
kindles, his narrative overwhelmed in the tide of
passions that it sways.</p>

<p>His vocabulary is extraordinarily rich, and here
again the contrast is great between his prose and
his verse. A full-bodied and picturesque dictionary
might be made of the words that occur only in
the prose. Most of these words would be found
to derive from the Saxon stock, which yields him
almost all his store of invective and vituperation.
The resources of his Latinised vocabulary enable
him to rise by successive gyrations to a point of
vantage above his prey, and then the downward
rush that strikes the quarry is a Saxon monosyllable.
In this cardinal point of art for those who have to
do with the English speech he became the teacher
of Burke, who, with a lesser wealth of Saxon at
his command, employed it with a more telling
parsimony.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_78">[78]</div>

<p>Milton avoids no word of humble origin, so it
serve his purpose. His contempt finds voice in
such expressions as to "huddle" prayers, and to
"keck" at wholesome food. Gehazi "rooks"
from Naaman; the bishops "prog and pander for
fees," and are "the common stales to countenance
every politic fetch that was then on foot." The
Presbyterians were earnest enough "while pluralities
greased them thick and deep"; the gentlemen
who accompanied King Charles in his assault
on the privileges of the House of Commons
were "the spawn and shipwreck of taverns and
dicing-houses." The people take their religion
from their minister "by scraps and mammocks,
as he dispenses it in his Sunday's dole"; and
"the superstitious man by his good will is an
atheist, but being scared from thence by the
pangs and gripes of a boiling conscience, all in
a pudder shuffles up to himself such a God and
such a worship as is most agreeable to remedy
his fear."</p>

<p>There were few incidents in Milton's career,
from his personal relations with his college tutor
to his choice of blank verse for his epic, that he
was not called upon at some time or other in his
life to explain and defend. When his free use of
homely figures and turns of speech was objected to
him, his answer was ready: "Doth not Christ
Himself teach the highest things by the similitude
<span class="pb" id="pg_79">[79]</span>
of old bottles and patched clothes? Doth He not
illustrate best things by things most evil? His
own coming to be as a thief in the night, and the
righteous man's wisdom to that of an unjust
steward?" But the defence is misleading, for the
rules that governed Milton's usage are not what
it would suggest. When he came to treat of the
best and highest things his use of native English
became more sparing and dainty, while the rank,
strong words that smack of the home soil were all
foregone.</p>

<p>His prose works, therefore, help us to appreciate
better the tribulations of the process whereby he
became a classic poet. Eclecticism and the severe
castigation of style are dangerous disciplines for
any but a rich temperament; from others they
produce only what is exquisite and thin and vapid.
The "stylist" of the modern world is generally an
interesting invalid; his complexion would lose all
its transparency if it were exposed to the weather;
his weak voice would never make itself heard in
the hubbub of the bazaar. Sunbeams cannot be extracted
from cucumbers, nor can the great manner
in literature emanate from a chill self-culture.
But Milton inherited the fulness and vigour of the
Elizabethans, and so could afford to write an epic
poem in a selection of the language really used by
men. The grandeur of <i>Paradise Lost</i> or <i>Samson
Agonistes</i> could never, by any conceivable device
<span class="pb" id="pg_80">[80]</span>
of chemistry or magic, be compounded from
delicate sensibilities and a superfine ear for music.
For the material of those palaces whole provinces
were pillaged, and the waste might furnish forth a city.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_81">[81]</div>


<h2><a id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br />PARADISE LOST: THE SCHEME</a></h2>

<p>A prerogative place among the great epics of
the world has sometimes been claimed for <i>Paradise
Lost</i>, on the ground that the theme it handles is
vaster and of a more universal human interest than
any handled by Milton's predecessors. It concerns
itself with the fortunes, not of a city or an empire,
but of the whole human race, and with that
particular event in the history of the race which
has moulded all its destinies. Around this event,
the plucking of an apple, are ranged, according to
the strictest rules of the ancient epic, the histories
of Heaven and Earth and Hell. The scene of the
action is Universal Space. The time represented
is Eternity. The characters are God and all his
Creatures. And all these are exhibited in the
clearest and most inevitable relation with the main
event, so that there is not an incident, hardly a
line of the poem, but leads backwards or forwards
to those central lines in the Ninth Book:--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_82">[82]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t">So saying, her rash hand in evil hour</div>
<div class="t0">Forth-reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat.</div>
<div class="t0">Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat,</div>
<div class="t0">Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe</div>
<div class="t0">That all was lost.</div>
</div>

<p>From this point radiates a plot so immense in
scope, that the history of the world from the first
preaching of the Gospel to the Millennium occupies
only some fifty lines of Milton's epilogue. And
if the plot be vast, the stage is large enough to set
it forth. The size of Milton's theatre gives to his
imagination those colossal scenical opportunities
which are turned to such magnificent account.
De Quincey enumerates some of them--"Heaven
opening to eject her rebellious children; the unvoyageable
depths of ancient Chaos, with its
'anarch old' and its eternal war of wrecks;
these traversed by that great leading Angel that
drew after him the third part of the heavenly host;
earliest Paradise dawning upon the warrior-angel
out of this far-distant 'sea without shore' of
chaos; the dreadful phantoms of Sin and Death,
prompted by secret sympathy and snuffing the
distant scent of 'mortal change on earth,' chasing
the steps of their great progenitor and sultan;
finally the heart-freezing visions, shown and narrated
to Adam, of human misery through vast
successions of shadowy generations: all these
scenical opportunities offered in the <i>Paradise Lost</i>
<span class="pb" id="pg_83">[83]</span>
become in the hands of the mighty artist elements
of undying grandeur not matched on earth."</p>

<p>All these grandeurs and beauties are as real
and living to-day as they were on the day when
Milton conceived them. But the other advantage
claimed for his epic, that it deals with matters of
the dearest concern to all of us, has been sharply
questioned. It was Mr. Pattison's complaint of
<i>Paradise Lost</i> that in it "Milton has taken a
scheme of life for life itself," and that it requires a
violent effort from the modern reader to accommodate
his conceptions to the anthropomorphic
theology of the poem. The world is now thickly
peopled with men and women who, having bestowed
their patronage on other ancestors, care little about
Adam and Eve, and who therefore feel that
Milton's poem is wanting in the note of actuality.
Satan himself is not what he used to be; he is
doubly fallen, in the esteem of his victims as well
as of his Maker, and indeed</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Comes to the place where he before had sat</div>
<div class="t0">Among the prime in splendour, now deposed,</div>
<div class="t0">Ejected, emptied, gazed, unpitied, shunned,</div>
<div class="t0">A spectacle of ruin.</div>
</div>

<p>"He who aspires," says Mr. Pattison, "to be the
poet of a nation is bound to adopt a hero who
is already dear to that people." But how if the
hero subsequently fall out of vogue, and his name
<span class="pb" id="pg_84">[84]</span>
lose its power with a fickle populace? Can even
a poet save him?</p>

<p>The drifting away of the popular belief from
the tenets of Milton's theology doubtless does
something to explain the lukewarm interest taken
by most educated English readers in <i>Paradise
Lost</i>. But it is a mistake to make much of this
explanation. Certainly Milton held his own
theological beliefs, as expounded in the poem, in
perfect good faith and with great tenacity. But
the generation after his own, which first gave him
his great fame, was not seduced into admiration
by any whole-hearted fellowship in belief. Dryden
laments the presence in the poem of so many
"machining persons,"--as he calls the supernatural
characters of <i>Paradise Lost</i>. At almost the same
date Dr. Thomas Burnet was causing a mild sensation
in the theological world by expounding the
earlier chapters of the Book of Genesis in an
allegorical sense, and denying to them the significance
of a literal history. Voltaire, while he praises
Milton, remarks that the topic of <i>Paradise Lost</i>
has afforded nothing among the French but some
lively lampoons, and that those who have the
highest respect for the mysteries of the Christian
religion cannot forbear now and then making free
with the devil, the serpent, the frailty of our first
parents, and the rib that was stolen from Adam.
"I have often admired," he goes on, "how barren
<span class="pb" id="pg_85">[85]</span>
the subject appears, and how fruitful it grows
under his hands."</p>

<p>It seems likely that Milton himself, before he
was fairly caught in the mesh of his own imagination,
was well aware that his subject demanded
something of the nature of a <i>tour de force</i>. He
had to give physical, geometric embodiment to a
far-reaching scheme of abstract speculation and
thought,--parts of it very reluctant to such a
treatment. The necessities of the epic form constrained
him. When Satan, on the top of Mount
Niphates, exclaims--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell;</div>
</div>

<p>when Michael promises to Adam, after his expulsion
from the garden--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">A Paradise within thee; happier far;</div>
</div>

<p>Milton must have known as well as any of his
critics that this conception of Hell and of Paradise,
if insisted on, would have shattered the fabric of
his poem. His figures of Sin and Death were of
his own invention, and we must not suppose him
so obtuse as never to have realised the part that
his shaping imagination bore in the presentment
of other and greater figures in the poem. In some
respects he tried rather to impose a scheme of
thought and imagination upon his age than to express
the ideas that he found current. His theology
and his cosmical conceptions are equally tainted
<span class="pb" id="pg_86">[86]</span>
with his individual heresies. He flies in the face
of the Athanasian Creed by representing the
generation of the Son as an event occurring in
time--"on such day as Heaven's great year
brings forth." His later poem of <i>Paradise Regained</i>
and the posthumous treatise of Christian
Doctrine show him an Arian; in the poem the
Almighty is made to speak of</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">This perfect man, by merit called my Son.</div>
</div>

<p>His account of the creation of the World as a mere
ordering or re-arrangement of the wild welter of
an uncreated material Chaos receives no countenance
from the Fathers. In many points of theological
teaching he is compelled to form definite
and even visual conceptions where orthodoxy had
cautiously confined itself to vague general propositions.
So that the description of Sin and Death
and of the causeway built by them between Hell-gates
and the World, much as it has been objected
to even by admirers of the poem, is only an
extreme instance of the defining and hardening
process that Milton found needful throughout for
the concrete presentment of the high doings which
are his theme. He congealed the mysteries of
Time and Space, Love and Death, Sin and Forgiveness,
into a material system; and in so doing,
while paying the utmost deference to his authorities,
he yet exercised many a choice with regard
<span class="pb" id="pg_87">[87]</span>
to matters indifferent or undefinable. Thus, for
instance, he borrows from the Talmud the notion
that Satan first learned the existence of a prohibited
tree from overhearing a conversation between
Adam and Eve. He was surely conscious of what
he was doing, and would have been not ill-pleased
to learn that the Universe, as he conceived of it,
has since been called by his name. It is Milton's
Paradise Lost, lost by Milton's Adam and Eve,
who are tempted by Milton's Satan, and punished
by Milton's God. The stamp of his clear hard
imagination is on the whole fabric; and it is not
much harder for us to coax ourselves into the
belief that his is indeed the very world we inhabit
than it was for the men of his own time. The
senses and the intellect are older than modern
science, and were employed to good effect before
the invention of the spectroscope; it is they in
their daily operation that make it difficult to leap
the gulf which separates the amenities and trivialities
of common life from the solemn theatre
of the poet's imagination. The objection that the
poem has lost much of its value because we are
compelled to imagine where our elders believed is
of little weight in a case like this, where our lack
of belief is not brought home to us until insuperable
difficulties are placed in the way of our
imagination. Where Milton was freest, there we
follow him most gladly; where he wrote in fetters,
<span class="pb" id="pg_88">[88]</span>
as notably in some of the scenes transacted in
Heaven, our imagination, not our belief, is the first
to rebel.</p>

<p>We are deceived by names; the more closely
<i>Paradise Lost</i> is studied, the more does the hand
of the author appear in every part. The epic
poem, which in its natural form is a kind of
cathedral for the ideas of a nation, is by him transformed
into a chapel-of-ease for his own mind, a
monument to his own genius and his own habits
of thought. The <i>Paradise Lost</i> is like the sculptured
tombs of the Medici in Florence; it is not
of Night and Morning, nor of Lorenzo and
Giuliano, that we think as we look at them,
but solely of the great creator, Michael Angelo.
The same dull convention that calls the <i>Paradise
Lost</i> a religious poem might call these Christian
statues. Each is primarily a great work of art
in each the traditions of two eras are blended in a
unity that is indicative of nothing but the character
and powers of the artist. The <i>Paradise Lost</i>
is not the less an eternal monument because it is a
monument to dead ideas.</p>

<p>We do not know exactly when Milton made
his choice of subject. His Latin verses addressed
to Manso, Marquis of Villa, in January 1638-9,
show that Arthur and the Round Table was at
that time the uppermost theme in his mind, and
that the warlike achievement of heroes was the
<span class="pb" id="pg_89">[89]</span>
aspect of it that most attracted him. After his
return to England in 1639, it is mentioned once
again in his elegy on Charles Diodati, and then
we hear no more of it. In the tentative list of
subjects, made in 1641, Arthur has disappeared,
and the story of <i>Paradise Lost</i> already occupies
the most conspicuous place, with four separate
drafts suggesting different treatments of the theme.</p>

<p>It would be idle to speculate on what Milton
might have made of the Arthur legends. One
thing is certain; he would have set up the warrior
king as a perfectly objective figure, hampered by
no allegory, and with no inward and spiritual signification.
The national cause, maintained heroically
in a hundred battles, and overwhelmed at
last by the brute violence of the foreign oppressor,
was subject enough for him; he would never have
marred his epic by sickly irresolution and the
struggles of a divided will in the principal characters.
Perhaps his mind reverted to his old
dreams when he came to describe the pastimes
wherewith the rebel angels beguile their time in
Hell:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t8">Others, more mild,</div>
<div class="t0">Retreated in a silent valley, sing</div>

<div class="t0">The thronging audience.</div>
</div>

<p>This is only one of the very numerous places in
<i>Paradise Lost</i> where, before he is well aware of it,
we catch Milton's sympathies dilating themselves
upon the wrong side.</p>

<p>His researches in British annals, begun at the
time when he was still in quest of a theme, convinced
him that the whole story of Arthur was
"obscured and blemished with fables." He
foraged among other British subjects, feeling that
the great poem which was designed to raise England
to the literary peerage and set her by the side of
countries of older fame must deal with a theme of
truly national import. Some of the subjects that
he jotted down were obviously of too incidental
and trivial a nature for his purpose, and a wise
instinct confined him to the earlier history of the
island, where his own freedom of treatment was less
likely to be hampered by an excess of detail.
And then, precisely how or when we do not know,
the idea came to him that he would treat a subject
still larger and of a more tremendous import,--the
fortunes, not of the nation, but of the race:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">With loss of Eden, till one greater Man</div>
<div class="t0">Restore us, and regain the blissful seat.</div>
</div>

<p>The attractions that this theme, once hit on,
<span class="pb" id="pg_91">[91]</span>
exercised on Milton's mind may easily be guessed.
In the first place, it was a sacred subject: an
opportunity for leading poetry back to its divine
allegiance; and, by the creation of a new species
of epic, an escape from a danger which must have
been very present to his mind--the danger of too
close an imitation of the ancients. More specific
reasons concurred in recommending it. In the
Garden of Eden he might present to an age which
was overrun with a corrupt religion and governed
by a decadent court the picture of a religion
without a church, of life in its primitive simplicity,
and of patriarchal worship without the
noisome accretions of later ceremonial. His
attitude to the Laudian movement is eloquently
expressed, at this same time, in the treatise <i>Of
Reformation in England</i>, where he describes how
the religious teachers of his own and preceding
ages "began to draw down all the divine intercourse
betwixt God and the soul, yea, the very
shape of God himself into an exterior and bodily
form, urgently pretending a necessity and obligement
of joining the body in a formal reverence and
worship circumscribed; they hallowed it, they
fumed it, they sprinkled it, they bedecked it, not
in robes of pure innocency, but of pure linen, with
other deformed and fantastic dresses, in palls and
mitres, gold, and gewgaws fetched from Aaron's
old wardrobe or the flamen's vestry: then was the
<span class="pb" id="pg_92">[92]</span>
priest set to con his motions and his postures, his
liturgies and his lurries, till the soul by this means
of over-bodying herself, given up justly to fleshly
delights, bated her wing apace downward: and
finding the ease she had from her visible and
sensuous colleague, the body, in performance of
religious duties, her pinions now broken and
flagging, shifted off from herself the labour of high
soaring any more, forgot her heavenly flight, and
left the dull and droiling carcase to plod on in the
old road and drudging trade of outward conformity."</p>

<p>But Adam and Eve, Milton is careful to explain,
were not ritualists. They recite their evening
hymn of praise as they stand at the entrance to
their shady lodge:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">This said unanimous, and other rites</div>
<div class="t0">Observing none, but adoration pure</div>
<div class="t0">Which God likes best, into their inmost bower</div>
<div class="t0">Handed they went.</div>
</div>

<p>The traits of Milton's Puritanism peep out at unexpected
places in the poem. The happy Garden,
Adam is told, will be destroyed after the Flood,
for a reason that would have been approved by
the image-breakers of the Commonwealth:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">To teach thee that God attributes to place</div>
<div class="t0">No sanctity, if none be thither brought</div>
<div class="t0">By men who there frequent, or therein dwell.</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_93">[93]</div>

<p>The palace of Pandemonium is built by Satan's
host in an hour, whence men may</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Learn how their greatest monuments of fame,</div>
<div class="t0">And strength, and art, are easily outdone</div>
<div class="t0">By spirits reprobate;</div>
</div>

<p>--a perfectly sound moral, well illustrating Mr.
Swinburne's remark that Puritanism has nothing
to do with Art, and that the great Puritans and
the great artists have never confused them.</p>

<p>Milton must also have been drawn to the theme
of <i>Paradise Lost</i> by the scope it promised for
scenes of quiet natural beauty:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t4">All that bowery loneliness,</div>
<div class="t0">The brooks of Eden mazily murmuring</div>
<div class="t0">And bloom profuse and cedar arches.</div>
</div>

<p>His imagination was so susceptible to a touch of
beauty that even in the bare sketch he has left for
a drama dealing with the story of Lot and his
escape from Sodom we see how likely he was, here
also, to fall into the error of <i>Comus</i>. As Lot entertains
the angels at supper, "the Gallantry of the
town passe by in Procession, with musick and song,
to the temple of Venus Urania." The opening
Chorus is to relate the course of the city, "each
evening every one with mistresse, or Ganymed,
gitterning along the streets, or solacing on the
banks of Jordan, or down the stream." But in
the story of the Garden of Eden the beauty was,
<span class="pb" id="pg_94">[94]</span>
for once, on the side of the morality; innocence
and purity might be depicted, not, as in a fallen
world, clad in complete steel, but at ease in their
native haunts, surrounded by all the inexhaustible
bounty of an unsubdued and uncorrupted Nature.</p>

<p>The chief dramatic interest of the poem, however,
comes in with the great outcast angel, stirred
up by his passions of envy and revenge to assault
the new-created inhabitants of the Garden. It
seems likely that Milton was drawn to this part of
his theme by chains of interest and sympathy
stronger than he confessed or knew. He was an
epic poet, striving to describe great events worthily,
but the dramatic situation betrayed him. He
knew only that he could draw a rebel leader, noble
in bearing, superbly outlined, a worthy adversary
of the Most High. But it happened to him, as it
has happened to others who have found themselves
in a position where Satan could do them a service;
before long, as if by some medi&aelig;val compact, the
relations are reversed, and the poet is in the service
of the Devil. He can hardly have foreseen this
chance; although there are not wanting signs in
the poem itself that, before it was half completed,
he became uneasily conscious of what was happening,
and attempted, too late, to remedy it. When
he chose his subject he doubtless intended that the
centre of interest should be fixed in the Garden of
Eden, and did not perceive how of necessity it
<span class="pb" id="pg_95">[95]</span>
must tend to sink lower, to that realm in the
shadow of darkness, innumerably more populous,
inhabited by beings of a nobler origin, of greater
(and more human) passions, with a longer and
more distinguished history, and with this further
claim upon the sympathy of the reader, that they
are doomed to an eternity of suffering.</p>

<p>It is worth our while as critics to try to put
ourselves in Milton's place at the time when he
had made his choice, that we may realise not only
the attractions but also the difficulties of the theme.
An Italian poet of the early seventeenth century,
Giovanni Battista Andreini, from whose drama,
entitled <i>Adamo</i>, Milton is alleged to have borrowed
some trifles, has made a very full and satisfactory
statement of these difficulties in the preface to his
play. He mentions, for instance, the unpromising
monotony of Adam's life during the time spent in
the earthly paradise, and the difficulty of giving
verisimilitude to the conversation between the
woman and the snake. But he waxes most eloquent
on the last and greatest difficulty--"since the
composition must remain deprived of those poetic
ornaments so dear to the Muses; deprived of the
power to draw comparisons from implements of
art introduced in the course of years, since in the
time of the first man there was no such thing;
deprived also of naming (at least while Adam
speaks or discourse is held with him), for example,
<span class="pb" id="pg_96">[96]</span>
bows, arrows, hatchets, urns, knives, swords, spears,
trumpets, drums, trophies, banners, lists, hammers,
torches, bellows, funeral piles, theatres, exchequers,
infinite things of a like nature, introduced by the
necessities of sin;... deprived moreover of
introducing points of history, sacred or profane, of
relating fictions of fabulous deities, of rehearsing
loves, furies, sports of hunting or fishing, triumphs,
shipwrecks, conflagrations, enchantments, and
things of a like nature, that are in truth the ornament
and the soul of poetry."</p>

<p>All these difficulties for Andreini's drama were
difficulties also for Milton's poem. Yet no reader
of <i>Paradise Lost</i> is found to complain that the
poem is lacking in poetic ornament. Milton has
successfully surmounted or evaded many of this
formidable catalogue of limitations, without the
sacrifice of dramatic propriety. It is true that in
the course of their morning orisons, addressed to
their Maker, Adam and Eve apostrophise the Mists
and Exhalations--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">that now rise</div>
<div class="t0">From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,</div>
<div class="t0">Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold;</div>
</div>

<p>--where, a purist might urge, neither of them had
any right to be acquainted with paint, or skirts, or
gold. But anachronisms like these are, after all,
only a part of the great anachronism, or postulate
rather, whereby Adam and Eve are made to speak
<span class="pb" id="pg_97">[97]</span>
the English tongue. In the Twelfth Book Michael
is guilty of a graver lapse where he mentions
baptism without explanation or apology. On the
other hand, Raphael, who had a pleasanter occasion
and more time for his retrospective summary, explains
the military man&oelig;uvring of angels by what
Adam had already seen of the flight of birds, and
after describing the great war in Heaven and the
fierce hosting of the opposed forces, ventures, at a
later point in his story, to illustrate the flowing
together of the congregated waters at the Creation
by a simile drawn, with apology, from the massing
of troops:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t9">As armies at the call</div>
<div class="t0">Of trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard)</div>
<div class="t0">Troop to their standard, so the watery throng,</div>
<div class="t0">Wave rolling after wave.</div>
</div>

<p>In the main Milton studies propriety with
regard to the forbidden matters enumerated by
Andreini. But he escapes from the full effect of
the prohibition by a variety of devices. In the
first place, there are the two chief episodes of the
poem; Raphael's narration, from the Fifth to the
Eighth Book, imparted to Adam as a warning
against impending dangers, and conveying an
account of the history of the Universe before the
Creation of Man; and Michael's narration, in the
Eleventh and Twelfth Books, consoling and
strengthening Adam, before the Expulsion from
<span class="pb" id="pg_98">[98]</span>
the Garden, by a rapid survey of the prospective
history of the World from that event down to the
Millennium. Considered as a narrator, Michael is
very subject to dullness; were it not for the unfailing
dignity and magniloquence of his diction,
his tale would be merely a bleak compendium of
the outlines of Scripture history; but to Raphael
is committed the story of the war in Heaven and
its amazing sequel,--a story containing passages so
brilliant, and so little necessary to be narrated at
length, that there is some flavour of inconsistency
in Milton's apology for his theme, prefixed to the
Ninth Book, where he describes himself as--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Not sedulous by nature to indite</div>
<div class="t0">Wars, hitherto the only argument</div>
<div class="t0">Heroic deemed, chief mastery to dissect</div>
<div class="t0">With long and tedious havoc fabled knights</div>
<div class="t0">In battles feigned (the better fortitude</div>
<div class="t0">Of patience and heroic martyrdom</div>
<div class="t0">Unsung), or to describe races and games</div>
<div class="t0">Or tilting furniture, emblazoned shields,</div>
<div class="t0">Impresses quaint, caparisons and steeds,</div>
<div class="t0">Bases and tinsel trappings, gorgeous knights</div>
<div class="t0">At joust and tournament; then marshalled feast</div>
<div class="t0">Served up in hall with sewers and seneshals:</div>
<div class="t0">The skill of artifice and office mean;</div>
<div class="t0">Not that which justly gives heroic name</div>
<div class="t0">To person or to poem! Me, of these</div>
<div class="t0">Nor skilled nor studious, higher argument</div>
<div class="t0">Remains, sufficient of itself to raise</div>
<div class="t0">That name, unless an age too late, or cold</div>
<div class="t0">Climate, or years, damp my intended wing</div>
<span class="pb" id="pg_99">[99]</span>
<div class="t0">Depressed; and much they may if all be mine,</div>
<div class="t0">Not hers who brings it nightly to my ear.</div>
</div>

<p>To depreciate war as a subject for the heroic
Muse was ungrateful in Milton, who had devoted
the whole of his Sixth Book to a description
of the "wild work in Heaven" caused by the
great rebellion, and had indulged his imagination
with some most extravagant fantasies; such as
the digging in the soil of Heaven for sulphur
and nitre (where the soil of Hell, it may be
remarked, yielded gold to the miner), the invention
of artillery, and the use of mountains
as missiles,</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire.</div>
</div>

<p>He had, moreover, attained to the height of the
sublime in that terrific closing scene where the Son,
riding forth in single majesty, drives the rebel host
over the crystal bounds of Heaven into the wasteful
abyss. Wars, in short, hold a conspicuous
place in the poem,--conflicts and broils so
enormous that--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t5">War seemed a civil game</div>
<div class="t0">To this uproar.</div>
</div>

<p>Races and athletic sports are among the melancholy
diversions of the dwellers in Hell during
their forced leisure. Even tilts and tournaments
are not absent from <i>Paradise Lost</i>, but they are
<span class="pb" id="pg_100">[100]</span>
introduced by the second of the devices which
enable Milton to extend the scope of his poem;
the free and frequent use, namely, of illustrative
and decorative comparisons. Thus the spacious
hall of Pandemonium is compared to--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t4">A covered field, where champions bold</div>
<div class="t0">Wont ride in armed, and at the Soldan's chair</div>
<div class="t0">Defied the best of Panim chivalry</div>
<div class="t0">To mortal combat, or career with lance.</div>
</div>

<p>It is plain that although almost all of the characters
of the poem are precluded from making allusion
to the events of human history, the poet himself is
free; and he uses his freedom throughout. Most
of the passages that have gained for Milton the
name of a learned poet are introduced by way of
simile. At times he employs the simplest epic
figure, drawn from the habits of rustic or animal
life. But his favourite figure is the "long-tailed
simile," or, as it is better called, the decorative
comparison, used for its ennobling, rather than for
its elucidating virtue. Here he parts company
with Homer, and even with Virgil, who could
draw on no such vast and various store of history,
geography, and romance. From Herodotus to
Olaus Magnus, and onward to the latest discoveries
in geography and astronomy, the researches of
Galileo, and the descriptions given by contemporary
travellers of China and the Chinese, or of the
<span class="pb" id="pg_101">[101]</span>
North American Indians, Milton compels the
authors he had read, both ancient and modern, to
contribute to the gracing of his work. It is partly
this wealth of implicit lore, still more, perhaps, the
subtly reminiscent character of much of his diction,
that justifies Mr. Pattison in the remark that
"an appreciation of Milton is the last reward of
consummated scholarship."</p>

<p>A third device, not the least remarkable of those
by which he gives elasticity to his theme, is to be
found in the tradition that he adopts with regard
to the later history of the fallen angels. A misunderstanding
of four verses in the fourteenth
chapter of Isaiah, and some cryptic allusions in the
Book of Revelations are the chief Scriptural
authorities for the Miltonic account of the Fall of
the Angels, which is not borrowed from the
Fathers, but corresponds rather with the later
version popularised in England by the cycles of
Miracle Plays. According to the <i>Divine Institutes</i>
of Lactantius, the nameless Angel, to whom from
the first had been given power over the new-created
Earth, was alone infected with envy of the Son of
God, his elder and superior, and set himself to
vitiate and destroy mankind in the cradle. He
tempted Eve, and she fell; after the expulsion
from Paradise he set himself also to corrupt the
guardian angels who were sent down from Heaven
for the protection and education of the increasing
<span class="pb" id="pg_102">[102]</span>
race of men. In this attempt also he succeeded;
"the sons of God saw the daughters of men that
they were fair, and they took them wives of all
which they chose." And they forgot their
heavenly estate, and made for themselves a Godless
dominion upon Earth. This is the Fall of the
Angels as it is narrated at greater length in the
recently recovered apocryphal <i>Book of Enoch</i>, and
alluded to, perhaps in the Epistles of Peter and
of Jude, where are mentioned "the angels that
sinned," and "the angels which kept not their
first estate." Milton's version brings these angels
to the earth, not as protectors of mankind, but as
conquerors come from Hell, to possess and occupy
the spacious world delivered over to them by the
victory of Satan. From that point forward, however,
he adopts the tradition whereby Jerome,
Lactantius, and others had identified the fallen
angels with the gods of the heathen. Whether as
conquerors or as corrupted guardians of the human
race, they seek the same ends,--to divert worship
from the true God, and by the destruction of man,
to contrive a solace for their own perdition. They
are the inventors of astrology, sooth-saying,
divination, necromancy, and black magic; they
were once the ministers of God, and still have a
presentiment of his acts, so that they can sometimes
speak truly of the future by means of oracles and
magicians, claiming the while the credit of bringing
<span class="pb" id="pg_103">[103]</span>
that to pass which in fact they only foresaw.
Milton, in adopting this doctrine, merely followed
current belief, and did not, as De Quincey seems to
think, hit upon it by a fortunate stroke of genius.
He might have found it incidentally but fully set
forth in so recent a book as Hooker's <i>Ecclesiastical
Polity</i>, I. iv. "The fall of the angels, therefore,"
says Hooker, "was pride. Since their fall, their
practices have been the clean contrary unto those
just mentioned. For, being dispersed, some in the
air, some in the earth, some in the water, some
among the minerals, dens, and caves that are under
the earth; they have by all means laboured to
effect a universal rebellion against the laws, and as
far as in them lieth utter destruction of the works
of God. These wicked spirits the heathen
honoured instead of Gods, both generally under
the name of <i>dii inferi</i>, 'gods infernal,' and
particularly, some in oracles, some in idols, some as
household gods, some as nymphs; in a word, no
foul or wicked spirit which was not one way or
other honoured of men as god, till such time as
light appeared in the world, and dissolved the
works of the Devil." The argument which Milton
himself sets forth for the support of this view was
accepted as conclusive in his own age. The Ionian
gods, he says, Titan, and Saturn, and Jove, and the
rest, the youngest branch of that evil and influential
family, were--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_104">[104]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">Held</div>
<div class="t0">Gods, yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth</div>
<div class="t0">Their boasted parents.</div>
</div>

<p>They ruled the middle air and had access to no
higher or purer heaven. Howsoever Milton came
by the doctrine, it was of enormous use to him;
it gave him names for his devils, and characters,
and a detailed history of the part they had played
in human affairs; it was, in short, a key to all the
mythologies.</p>

<p>By these devices the author of <i>Paradise Lost</i>
escapes the impoverishment of imagination that
his subject seemed to impose upon him. On
looking once more over Andreini's list of prohibited
topics, we are surprised to find how many
of them Milton has found a place for. He does
introduce points of history, sacred and profane;
he relates fictions of fabulous deities; he rehearses
loves, furies, triumphs, conflagrations, and things
of a like nature. The principal conflagration that
he describes is on a very large scale; and the
majestic ascent of the Son--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Up to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode,</div>
<div class="t0"><span class="gsw">*      *      *      *      *</span></div>
<div class="t0">Followed with acclamation, and the sound</div>
<div class="t0">Symphonious often thousand harps, that tuned</div>
<div class="t0">Angelic harmonies,</div>
</div>

<p>is the grandest triumphal procession in all literature.
On the other hand, he manages to dispense with
<span class="pb" id="pg_105">[105]</span>
some of the institutions and implements "introduced
by the necessities of sin." He has
swords and spears, trumpets and drums in plenty.
But he has no knives, nor hatchets, nor bellows;
and no theatres nor exchequers. There are no
urns nor funeral piles, because there is no death;
or rather, because the only Death that there is
increases the number of persons in the poem by
one. Sports of hunting and fishing there are, of
course, none; and, although it is an heroic poem, the
horse takes little part in the celestial war, is hardly
known in hell, and is unheard of on earth until
Adam beholds in vision the armed concourse of
his corrupt descendants. Nevertheless, the general
impression left by the poem is one of richness
rather than poverty of poetic ornament. The
wealth is most profusely displayed in the books
treating of Satan and his followers, but it is not
absent from Eden nor from the empyreal Heaven,
although in the one case the monotony of the
situation, and in the other the poet's evident
anxiety to authorise his every step from Scripture,
prevent the full display of his power. But Milton
is a difficult poet to disable; he is often seen at
his best on the tritest theme, which he handles
after his own grave fashion by comprehensive
statement, measured and appropriate, heightened
by none save the most obvious metaphors, and
depending for almost all its charm on the quiet
<span class="pb" id="pg_106">[106]</span>
colouring of the inevitable epithet, and the solemn
music of the cadence:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray</div>
<div class="t0">Had in her sober livery all things clad;</div>
<div class="t0">Silence accompanied; for beast and bird</div>
<div class="t0">They to their grassy couch, these to their nests,</div>
<div class="t0">Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale.</div>
<div class="t0">She all night long her amorous descant sung:</div>
<div class="t0">Silence was pleased. Now glowed the firmament</div>
<div class="t0">With living sapphires; Hesperus, that led</div>
<div class="t0">The starry host, rode brightest, till the Moon,</div>
<div class="t0">Rising in clouded majesty, at length</div>
<div class="t0">Apparent queen, unveiled her peerless light,</div>
<div class="t0">And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.</div>
</div>

<p>Darkness, silence, rest, the nightingale's song, the
stars, the rising of the moon--these are all the
material of this wonderful passage. Yet did ever
such beauty fall with night upon such peace, save
in Paradise alone?</p>

<p>Once he had got his story, based on his few
authorities, with hints unconsciously taken and
touches added, perhaps, from his reading of other
poets--of C&aelig;dmon, Andreini, and Vondel, of
Spenser, Sylvester, Crashaw, and the Fletchers--Milton's
first task was to reduce it to the strict
relations of time and space. His blindness
probably helped him by relieving him from the
hourly solicitations of the visible world, and giving
him a dark and vacant space in which to rear his
geometric fabric. Against this background the
<span class="pb" id="pg_107">[107]</span>
figures of his characters are outlined in shapes of
light, and in this vacancy he mapped out his local
Heaven and Hell.</p>

<p>Heaven, as Milton portrays it, is a plain of vast
extent, diversified with hills, valleys, woods and
streams. In the Second Book he speaks of it as--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">Extended wide</div>
<div class="t0">In circuit, undetermined square or round;</div>
</div>

<p>in the Tenth Book it is determined, and is square.
It is bounded by battlements of living sapphire,
and towers of opal. In the midst is situated a
Mount, the dwelling place of the Most High,
surrounded by golden lamps, which diffuse night
and day alternately--for without twilight and
dawn, his dearest memories, Heaven would have
been no Heaven to Milton. On a mountain far
to the north of this great plain, Satan erects his
pyramids and towers of diamond and gold, and
establishes his empire, which lasts exactly three
days. At his final overthrow the crystal wall of
Heaven rolls back, disclosing a gap into the abyss;
the rebels, tortured with plagues and thunder,
fling themselves in desperation over the verge.
They fall for nine days, through Chaos. Chaos is
the realm of a king of the same name, who reigns
over it with his consort Night. It is of immeasurable
extent, quite dark, and turbulent with the raw
material of the Cosmos. Just as Milton, for the
<span class="pb" id="pg_108">[108]</span>
purposes of his poem, followed the older astronomy,
and gave to it a new lease of life in the popular
imagination, so also he abides by the older physics.
The orderly created World, or Cosmos, is conceived
as compounded of four elements, Earth, Air, Fire,
and Water. None of these four is to be found in
Chaos, for each of them is composed of the simpler
atoms of Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, symmetrically
arranged in pairs. Thus Air is Hot and Moist,
Fire is Hot and Dry, Water is Cold and Moist,
Earth is Cold and Dry. Before they are separated
and blended by Divine command, the four rudimentary
constituents of creation are crowded in
repulsive contiguity; they bubble and welter, fight
and jostle in the dark, with hideous noises. In
its upper strata Chaos is calmer, and is faintly
lighted by the effulgence from the partially transparent
walls of Heaven.</p>

<p>Below is Hell, newly prepared for the rebels.
Like Heaven it is a vast plain; a bituminous lake,
played over by livid flames, is one of its principal
features; and hard by stands a volcanic mountain,
at the foot of which the devils build their palace,
and hold their assembly. The nine-fold gates of
Hell, far distant, are guarded by Sin and Death,
the paramour and the son of Satan. No one has
plausibly explained how they came by their office.
It was intended to be a perfect sinecure; there was
no one to be let in and no one to be let out. The
<span class="pb" id="pg_109">[109]</span>
single occasion that presented itself for a neglect
of their duty was by them eagerly seized.</p>

<p>During the nine days while the rebels lay on
the burning lake, drowsed by its fumes, the World
was created. It consists, according to the
astronomy followed by Milton, of ten concentric
spheres fitted, like Chinese boxes, one within
another, and the Earth in the centre. Nine of
these are transparent, the spheres, that is to say, of
the seven planets (the Sun and the Moon being
reckoned as planets), the sphere of the fixed stars,
and the crystalline sphere. The outermost sphere,
or <i>primum mobile</i>, is opaque and impervious. The
whole orbicular World hangs by a golden chain
from that part of the battlements of Heaven
whence the angels fell. It is connected with
Heaven by richly jewelled stairs, to be let down
or taken up at pleasure, and can be entered only
through an orifice or passage at the top. Between
the foot of the stairs and the entrance to the
World is a sea or lake of jasper and liquid pearl.</p>

<p>All the interest and meaning of the World is
centred in one favoured spot of Earth. Eden is a
district of Mesopotamia, and the happy garden,
called Paradise, is situated in the east of Eden.
It is a raised table-land, surrounded on all sides by
a high ridge of hill, thickly wooded, and impenetrable.
Its single gate, hewn out of a rock
of alabaster, faces eastward, and is accessible only
<span class="pb" id="pg_110">[110]</span>
by a pass leading up from the plain and overhung
by craggy cliffs. Through Eden runs a river
which passes by a tunnel under Paradise, and,
rising through the porous earth, waters the garden
with springs. It was by this underground passage
that Satan entered the garden a second time, when,
having been discovered by Ithuriel, and expelled
by Gabriel, he had circled the Earth seven times,
keeping on the shady side to avoid the gaze of
Uriel, and at the end of the week had resolved on
another attempt.</p>

<p>The Fall of Man wrought some few changes in
the physical configuration of the Universe. Sin
and Death built the mighty causeway that connects
the orifice of the World with Hell-gates. Provision
had to be made under the new dispensation
for the peopling of the whole surface of the Earth;
so the axis was turned askew, and the beginning
ordained of extremes of cold and heat, of storms
and droughts, and noxious planetary influences.
Night and day were known to man in his sinless
state, but the seasons date from his transgression.</p>

<p>The time-scheme of the poem is less carefully
defined; indeed, it is not certain that Milton
intended accurately to define it. The recurrence
of the numbers three and nine, numbers traditionally
honoured by poetry, throws suspicion on the
efforts of the exact commentators. Even in his
statements with regard to spatial relations the poet
<span class="pb" id="pg_111">[111]</span>
was not always minutely consistent with himself.
The distance from the plain of Heaven to the
plain of Hell is said in the First Book to be three
times the radius of the World, or, in his own
words, the prison of Hell is</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">As far removed from God and light of Heaven</div>
<div class="t0">As from the centre thrice to the utmost pole.</div>
</div>

<p>The great globe, therefore, that hangs from the
floor of Heaven reaches two-thirds of the way
down to Hell. Yet in the Second Book Satan,
after a long and perilous journey from Hell,
comes in view of</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">This pendent World, in bigness as a star</div>
<div class="t0">Of smallest magnitude close by the moon.</div>
</div>

<p>So small is the World, compared with the wide
extent of the empyreal Heaven. But it is not
easy to conceive how, in the limited space between
Heaven and Hell, the World could so appear to
Satan.</p>

<p>A like curious consideration of the passages
where time is mentioned reveals a gap in the tale
of days enumerated by Milton. We are not told
how long it took Satan to reach the Earth. Driven
back on precedents and analogies we find them
conflicting. The outcast angels took nine days to
fall the same distance. But falling, as Moloch
points out in his speech at the Infernal Council,
was to them less natural than rising; and Raphael,
<span class="pb" id="pg_112">[112]</span>
who was subsequently sent to guard the gates of
Hell during the Creation, made the ascent easily
in part of a day. If we allow a day and a night
for Satan's exploratory voyage, the action of the
poem, from the heavenly decree which occasioned
the rebellion, to the expulsion of Adam and Eve
from Paradise, has been found to occupy thirty-three
days, some measured by a heavenly, some by
an earthly standard. This would make Adam and
Eve about ten days old when they fell. But St.
Augustine says that they spent six years in the
Earthly Paradise, and the question is better left
open.</p>

<p>A graver inconsistency is brought to light by
a close study of the framework of the poem.
Milton seems to have hesitated as to which of two
theories he would adopt concerning the Creation
of Man. After their fall both Satan and Beelzebub
mention a rumour which had long been current
in Heaven of a new race, called Man, shortly
to be created. That rumour could hardly have
reached the rebels during the progress of the
war. Yet in the Seventh Book the Creation
appears as a compliment paid to Satan, a counter-move
devised after the suppression of the great
rebellion. The Omnipotent thus declares his
intention:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">But, lest his heart exalt him in the harm</div>
<div class="t0">Already done, to have dispeopled Heaven--</div>
<span class="pb" id="pg_113">[113]</span>
<div class="t0">My damage fondly deemed,--I can repair</div>
<div class="t0">That detriment, if such it be to lose</div>
<div class="t0">Self-lost, and in a moment will create</div>
<div class="t0">Another world; out of one man a race</div>
<div class="t0">Of men innumerable.</div>
</div>

<p>This last is the account we must accept.
Milton no doubt was attracted by the dramatic
superiority of this version, which makes the
Creation of Man a minor incident in the great
war, so that the human race comes, a mere token
and pawn--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Between the pass and fell incensed points</div>
<div class="t0">Of mighty opposites.</div>
</div>

<p>But he was probably also aware that this view had
not the highest warrant of orthodoxy.</p>

<p>There is something absurd, perhaps even something
repulsive, to the modern mind in this
careful, matter-of-fact anatomy of Milton's poem.
But it is a useful and necessary exercise, for all his
greatest effects are achieved in the realm of the
physical and moral sublime, where the moral
relations are conditioned chiefly by the physical.
There is no metaphysic, nothing spiritual, nothing
mysterious, except in name, throughout the whole
poem. The so-called spiritual beings are as
definitely embodied as man. The rules that
Milton followed in dealing with his heavenly
essences are very fully laid down in the <i>Treatise
of Christian Doctrine</i>. He consigned the Fathers
<span class="pb" id="pg_114">[114]</span>
to limbo, and built up his entire system from the
words of Scripture. Now the Scriptures, in a
hundred passages, attribute human passions and
actions to Divine beings. We have no choice,
said Milton, but to accept these expressions as the
truest to which we can attain. "If after the work
of six days it be said of God that 'He rested and
was refreshed,' <i>Exodus</i>, xxxi. 17; if it be said
that 'He feared the wrath of the enemy,' <i>Deuteronomy</i>,
xxxii. 27; let us believe that it is not
beneath the dignity of God ... to be refreshed
in that which refresheth Him, or to fear in that
He feareth." Milton had here the sharp logical
dilemma that he loved. Either these expressions
are literally true, or they are not. If they are,
well and good; if they are not, how can we hope
to frame for ourselves better and truer notions of
the Deity than those which he has dictated to us as
within the reach of our understanding, and fit and
proper for us to entertain? So also with angelic
beings: Milton dismisses the nine orders of the
apocryphal hierarchy--although he enumerates five
of them, in the wrong order, in the roll of that
recurring verse--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers--</div>
</div>

<p>and bases himself upon Scripture. There he finds
mention of seven chief angels, with some kind of
pre-eminence enjoyed by Michael. In the poem
<span class="pb" id="pg_115">[115]</span>
he finds employment for only four, Michael,
Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel, with a few Seraphim
and Cherubim, to whom he invariably, and very
improperly, assigns a subordinate position.</p>

<p>His angels fight and play games, as they were
doing at the gate of Paradise on the evening
when Satan first appeared there. They wear solid
armour, and so fall a ready prey to the artillery of
their foes--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t6">Unarmed they might</div>
<div class="t0">Have easily, as spirits, evaded swift</div>
<div class="t0">By quick contraction or remove; but now</div>
<div class="t0">Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout.</div>
</div>

<p>They eat and drink and digest; they even--and
here, though we be armed with triple brass, we
cannot avoid a sense of shock--they even blush
when an indiscreet question is asked of them.
When Raphael colours at the inquisitive demands
of Adam, it gives a melancholy force to his earlier
suggestion--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">What if Earth</div>
<div class="t0">Be but the shadow of Heaven, and things therein</div>
<div class="t0">Each to other like more than on Earth is thought?</div>
</div>

<p>This is the scheme of things, and these are the
actors, that Milton sets in motion. We shall do
well to accept the limitations he assigns, and to
look in his poem only for what is to be found
there. It would be a wearisome and fruitless quest
to journey through the <i>Paradise Lost</i> in search of
<span class="pb" id="pg_116">[116]</span>
those profound touches of humanity, and those
sudden felicities of insight, which abound in the
Elizabethans. Subtleties of thought, fine observation
of truths that almost evade the attempt to
express them, sentences and figures illuminative of
the mysteries of human destiny and the intricacies
of human character--of all these there is none.
If an author's works are to be used as a treasury
or garner of wise and striking sayings, the harvest
of sensibility and experience, <i>Paradise Lost</i> will
yield only a poor handful of gleanings. One such
reflection, enforced by a happy figure, occurs in
the Third Book, where Satan, disguised as a
youthful Cherub, deceives the Archangel Uriel--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">So spake the false dissembler unperceived;</div>
<div class="t0">For neither man nor angel can discern</div>
<div class="t0">Hypocrisy--the only evil that walks</div>
<div class="t0">Invisible, except to God alone,</div>
<div class="t0">By His permissive will, through Heaven and Earth;</div>
<div class="t0">And oft, though Wisdom wake, Suspicion sleeps</div>
<div class="t0">At Wisdom's gate, and to Simplicity</div>
<div class="t0">Resigns her charge, while Goodness thinks no ill</div>
<div class="t0">Where no ill seems.</div>
</div>

<p>Milton plainly had known hypocrisy, and had been
deceived by it. But it would be difficult to match
this reflection with any single other passage in the
whole poem. To say that such reflections are
common in Shakespeare would be too moderate a
statement; they are the very air he breathes.
<span class="pb" id="pg_117">[117]</span>
And even in the lesser dramatists the happy
embodiment of observation in a telling figure is
to be found on every page. An acute criticism,
for instance, is condensed in a dramatic form by
Ford, where he describes what may be called low
politeness--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t7">Smooth formality</div>
<div class="t0">Is usher to the rankness of the blood,</div>
<div class="t0">But impudence bears up the train.</div>
</div>

<p>The peculiar combination of formality and impudence
that marks ill-breeding was never more
happily described than in this figure; the mock
solemnity of the usher comes first, and is soon
followed by the grimacing antics of the page, while
each in his own way implies that the advances of
courtesy are a pomp and a deceit. Metaphors of
the same kind abound in the work of more modern
analytic poets. Here is another parable of a door-keeper,
more poetic than Milton's:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">They say that Pity in Love's service dwells,</div>
<div class="t0">A porter at the rosy temple's gate.</div>
<div class="t0">I missed him going; but it is my fate</div>
<div class="t0">To come upon him now beside his wells;</div>
<div class="t0">Whereby I know that I Love's temple leave,</div>
<div class="t0">And that the purple doors have closed behind.</div>
</div>

<p>In Milton's poetry we find ourselves in a
remote atmosphere; far indeed from the shrewd
observation of daily life, farther even from that
wonderful analysis of emotion which is the pastime
<span class="pb" id="pg_118">[118]</span>
of Shakespeare and of Meredith. Beautiful
figured writing and keen psychological observation
of this kind are beside the purpose of Milton, and
beyond his power.</p>

<p>For the time we must forego the attempt to
see into the life of things, and must accept in
imagination our position as citizens in this strange
majestic commonwealth of angels and men. It is
no mean city. Noble shapes pass before our eyes.
High language is held, and great wars are waged.
Events of tremendous import roll on to their
destined accomplishment. Golden processions
move across the dim expanse of Chaos. Worlds
are blown and broken like bubbles. There is
concerted song, feasting, and gratulation; dire
plots are hatched and blaze forth into light; will
clashes with will; Heaven opens, and a torrent of
flaming ruin is poured forth into the deep. The
Victor, ensconced in his omnipotence, is fiercely
triumphant; and in the dark below there is the
dull gleam of unconquered pride, deadly courage,
and immortal despair. But in the midst of all
this vast rivalry of interests and jar of opposed
systems, a cry is heard, like that muffled cry which
caught Macbeth's ear as he nerved himself for his
last fight. It is the cry of the human soul, left
homeless and derelict in a universe where she is the
only alien. For her the amaranth of the empyreal
Heaven is as comfortless as the adamant of Hell.
<span class="pb" id="pg_119">[119]</span>
She has lost her Paradise even while Adam's was
building--the Paradise where the flowers fade, and
loves and hates are mortal.</p>

<p>In the poem itself signs are not wanting that
Milton felt the terrible strain imposed upon him
by the intense and prolonged abstraction of his
theme--its unreality and superhuman elevation.
Some of the comparisons that he chooses to illustrate
scenes in Hell are taken from the incidents
of simple rustic life, and by their contrast with the
lurid creatures of his imagination come like a
draught of cold water to a traveller in a tropical
waste of sand and thorns. It is almost as if the
poet himself were oppressed by the suffocation of
the atmosphere that he has created, and, gasping
for breath, sought relief by summoning up to
remembrance the sweet security of pastoral life.
So, when the devils are shrunk to enter Pandemonium,
they are compared to</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">Faery elves</div>
<div class="t0">Whose midnight revels, by a forest-side</div>
<div class="t0">Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,</div>
<div class="t0">Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon</div>
<div class="t0">Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth</div>
<div class="t0">Wheels her pale course.</div>
</div>

<p>The rejoicings, again, at the end of the infernal
consultation, are described in a figure that makes a
like impression, and brings the same momentary
relief--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_120">[120]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds</div>
<div class="t0">Ascending, while the North-wind sleeps, o'erspread</div>
<div class="t0">Heaven's cheerful face, the louring element</div>
<div class="t0">Scowls o'er the darkened landskip snow or shower,</div>
<div class="t0">If chance the radiant sun, with farewell sweet,</div>
<div class="t0">Extend his evening beam, the fields revive,</div>
<div class="t0">The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds</div>
<div class="t0">Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.</div>
</div>

<p>The splendid artifice of contrast, noted by De
Quincey as one of the subtlest of Milton's
devices, is illustrated, perhaps, by both these
passages. De Quincey instances neither, but
chooses, as examples of the way in which two
images may act and react, heightening each other
by contrast--first, the use of architectural terms in
describing Paradise; next, the exhibition of a
banquet in the desert in <i>Paradise Regained</i>--"stimulating
the sense of its utter solitude and
remotion from men and cities"; and, last and
best, the comparison of Satan, in the same poem,
to an old man gathering sticks upon a winter's
day. "The household image of old age, of
human infirmity, and of domestic hearths, are all
meant as a machinery for provoking and soliciting
the fearful idea to which they are placed in
collision, and as so many repelling poles."</p>

<p>This is clever criticism and true philosophy.
But the chief effect from the more elaborate
figures of this kind is to be found merely in the
reprieve and refreshment that they bring. There
<span class="pb" id="pg_121">[121]</span>
is a sense of pathos, almost of tears, in being
allowed, for one moment only, to taste reality
again, to revisit familiar scenes, before we are
once more bound on the slow wheel of unnatural
events that is urged forward by the poet. Nothing
in Eden comes home to the feelings more directly
than the simile used to describe Satan as he watches
Eve on the morning of the temptation--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">As one who, long in populous city pent,</div>
<div class="t0">Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air,</div>
<div class="t0">Forth issuing on a summer's morn, to breathe</div>
<div class="t0">Among the pleasant villages and farms</div>
<div class="t0">Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight--</div>
<div class="t0">The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine,</div>
<div class="t0">Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound--</div>
<div class="t0">If chance with nymph-like step fair virgin pass,</div>
<div class="t0">What pleasing seemed for her now pleases more,</div>
<div class="t0">She most, and in her look sums all delight:</div>
<div class="t0">Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold</div>
<div class="t0">This flowery plot, the sweet recess of Eve.</div>
</div>

<p>The Serpent is glad to escape from Hell, to
breathe the morning air of Eden. But how glad
we are to escape from Eden</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">To breathe</div>
<div class="t0">Among the pleasant villages and farms!</div>
</div>

<p>There are no villages and farms in Eden, no
smell of hay, no sheaves of corn, no cottages, no
roads, and no trace of that most human of
symbols, the thin blue scarf of smoke rising from
<span class="pb" id="pg_122">[122]</span>
a wayside encampment. Even when we are
privileged to assist at the first festal celebration
of hospitality on Earth, the dinner given to the
Angel, for which Eve gathers</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t9">Fruit of all kinds, in coat</div>
<div class="t0">Rough or smooth rined, or bearded husk, or shell,</div>
</div>

<p>and heaps them, with bountiful hand, on the table
of raised turf, we are not perfectly at ease with
our hosts. Not all the dignity of Adam, nor all
the beauty of Eve, can make us forget that they
are nut-eaters, that they have not the art of
cooking, and do not ferment the juice of the
grape. A short stay in Eden teaches us the sad
truth that we are dependent, not only for the
pleasures of our life, but even for many of the
dearest pleasures of our imagination, on the
devices "introduced by the necessities of sin."
We cannot settle down in the midst of this
"enormous bliss"; we wander through the place,
open-mouthed with wonder, like country visitors
admiring the Crown jewels, and then--we long to
be at home.</p>

<p>There are no children in any of Milton's
poems. The introduction, in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, of a
real human child, such as Shakespeare brings into
<i>Coriolanus</i> or <i>Macbeth</i>, would be like the bringing
of a spark of fire into a powder magazine. None
of these edifying speeches could be made in the
<span class="pb" id="pg_123">[123]</span>
presence of such an auditor, or such a critic. The
whole system would be blown into fragments; the
artificial perspective that Milton preserves with so
great care would lose its glamour at a touch.
Hell and Heaven and Eden would dissolve away
like the baseless fabric of a vision, a scholar's
nightmare, if once they were subjected to the free
scrutiny of a child.</p>

<p><i>Paradise Lost</i> will not bear--it could at no
time, not even in the most theological of ages,
have borne--the more searching tests of realism,
of verisimilitude, and credibility. It is all the
greater skill in the poet that by his careful
handling of our imagination and feelings he
actually does produce "that willing suspension of
disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic
faith." The less it will endure the trial as a
system or theory of the universe, the more wonderful
does it appear as a work of art. By the most
delicate skill of architecture this gigantic filamented
structure has been raised into the air. It looks
like some enchanted palace that has lighted on the
ground for a moment, resting in its flight. It is
really the product of the most elaborate and careful
engineering science; the strains and stresses
put on every part of the material have been
calculated and allowed for. The poise and balance
are so minutely exact that it just stands, and no
more. But that it should stand at all is the
<span class="pb" id="pg_124">[124]</span>
marvel, seeing that it is spanned on frail arches
over the abyss of the impossible, the unnatural,
and the grotesque. Let it be granted that, in its
main features, the system of <i>Paradise Lost</i> does
correspond with what was and is the religious
creed of not a few people. There is many a
religious creed, strongly held, which is convincing
enough until the imagination begins to work
it out in detail, to try to realise it, in a clear
light, as a connected whole. Then either the
imagination or the creed must give way. The
remarkable thing about Milton's achievement is
that <i>Paradise Lost</i> is both a creed and a cosmical
scheme of imagination, and that, except here and
there, it is impossible to point to parts of the
poem and say, "Here he ceased to believe," or
"Here he gave up the effort to imagine." He
both imagined and believed throughout; he projected
himself, like a sleep-walker, into the
mammoth caves of his antediluvian dreams, and
lived among his own radiant and shadowy creations.
We need not, therefore, be surprised to
find that, in the first place, his daughters ran wild,
and neither liked nor understood their father; and
that, in the second place, for the rendering of his
thought he invented a system of preternaturally
majestic diction, perfectly fitted for the utterance
of his own conceptions, but, when divorced from
those conceptions, so monstrously artificial in
<span class="pb" id="pg_125">[125]</span>
effect, that his imitators and followers, hoisting
themselves on the Miltonic stilts, brought the very
name of "poetic diction" into a contempt that has
lasted for more than a century, and is not yet
wholly extinct.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_126">[126]</div>


<h2><a id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br />PARADISE LOST: THE ACTORS. THE LATER POEMS</a></h2>

<p>The difficulties which Milton felt and conquered
in the making of his epic masterpiece had their
origin, for the most part, in the intractable and
barren nature of his chosen theme. The dangers
that beset him, and sometimes tripped his feet,
arose, on the other hand, from his own declared
intention in the handling of that theme:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">That, to the highth of this great argument,</div>
<div class="t0">I may assert Eternal Providence</div>
<div class="t0">And justify the ways of God to men.</div>
</div>

<p>The pursuit of this argumentative end led him
through strange passes. A less courageous or a
more sensitive man might well have hesitated at
the entrance. But Milton hesitated at nothing.
The ultimate mysteries of human existence and
Divine government were no mysteries to him.</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">The living Throne, the sapphire blaze,</div>
<div class="t0">Where angels tremble, while they gaze,</div>
<div class="t0">He saw;</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_127">[127]</div>

<p>--and he did not tremble. His persons are
visible, their characters are known, the nature of
their relations is easily ascertained and expounded.
Everything, in short, is as plain as a pikestaff. So
he came to picture scenes which criticism is
reluctant to traverse, and to make statements
which it is equally irreverent either to affirm or to
deny.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, with a fearful and sincere piety,
refused to follow Milton into Heaven. "Of the
agents in the poem," he says, "the chief are such
as it is irreverence to name on slight occasions."
And again:--"The characters in the <i>Paradise Lost</i>
which admit of examination are those of angels and
of man." It is impossible not to respect Johnson's
attitude, but later critics have found it difficult to
follow his example, and Milton himself would
have been the last to claim sanctuary in Heaven
for the imaginations on which the whole fabric of
the poem depends.</p>

<p>Coleridge is one of the very few critics who
have praised the conduct of the celestial part of
the story:--"Wherever God is represented as
acting directly as Creator, without any exhibition
of his own essence, Milton adopts the simplest and
sternest language of the Scriptures.... But, as
some personal interest was demanded for the purposes
of poetry, Milton takes advantage of the
dramatic representation of God's address to the
<span class="pb" id="pg_128">[128]</span>
Son, the Filial Alterity, and in <i>those addresses</i> slips
in, as it were by stealth, language of affection, or
thought, or sentiment.... He was very wise
in adopting the strong anthropomorphism of the
Hebrew Scriptures at once." Yet this is hardly
an answer to the chief objections that have been
urged against Milton's conduct of the poem.
These are grounded, not on his adoption of the
strong anthropomorphism of the Hebrew Scriptures,
but on the nature of the matter that he
slips in, "as if by stealth," and the character that
he attributes to his Divine persons. Had he been
a pagan, pure and simple, he might have been
frankly and explicitly materialistic in his conceptions.
Had he been touched by the spirit of the
greatest of Christian poets, he might have
shrouded the Godhead in a mystery of silence and
light. But he had something to prove to the men
of his own time, and neither course served him.</p>

<p>Milton's theodicy is of his own devising, and
is neither Catholic nor Calvinist. His heresies
may be reduced to a single point; the ultimate
basis on which he rests the universe is political,
not religious. The fierce simplicity of his processes
of thought here led him straight into a
trap. Law to him is an expression of Will, enforced
by due penalties. As promulgated by human
authority, laws are to be obeyed only if they do
not clash with the dictates of a higher Power.
<span class="pb" id="pg_129">[129]</span>
The laws of God are subject to no such restraint.
They are; and, save by faith, there is no further
word to be said. But Milton had set himself to
justify these laws by reason. Destitute as he was
of speculative power, he attempted no transcendental
amalgam of diverse conceptions, of Love
and Law, of Mercy and Justice. He fell back on
Law as the naked assertion of Will, and helped out
the ancient argument of the pot and the potter
with a utilitarian appeal, which he puts into the
mouth of a Seraph, to the happy working of the
Divine laws in practice.</p>

<p>So it comes about that the main argument of
the poem is founded on an outrage done to religion.
In the place and under the name of Him
"with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of
turning," Milton set up in Heaven a whimsical
Tyrant, all of whose laws are arbitrary and occasional,
and who exacts from his creatures an
obedience that differs from brute submission in
one point only, that by the gift of free-will it is
put within their power to disobey. His commands,
like his laws, are issued from time to time.
Sometimes they enjoin the impossible on his subjects;
as when Michael and Gabriel, at the head
of the heavenly host, are ordered to drive Satan
and his crew out of Heaven into the abyss--a task
they prove wholly unable to accomplish. Sometimes
orders are given merely as an assertion of
<span class="pb" id="pg_130">[130]</span>
power, and to test submission; as when Raphael
is sent to keep the rebels confined in Hell, and
explains subsequently to Adam:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Not that they durst without his leave attempt;</div>
<div class="t0">But us he sends upon his high behests</div>
<div class="t0">For state, as sovran King, and to inure</div>
<div class="t0">Our prompt obedience.</div>
</div>

<p>The particular event with which, according to
Milton, the whole history begins is presented with
a crudity that would have horrified the Fathers.
The appointment of a Vicegerent to the Almighty,
and the edict requiring homage to be done to him,
are announced "on a day" to the host of Angels
assembled by special summons for this purpose.
During the night following, one of the chief
Archangels, thereafter called Satan, draws off his
forces to the north under pretext of preparing a
welcome for the new Commander, who is to make
a progress through his domain, promulgating more
new laws. The purpose of the rebels is discerned
by the All-Knowing, who makes this strange
speech to the Son:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Let us advise, and to this hazard draw</div>
<div class="t0">With speed what force is left, and all employ</div>
<div class="t0">In our defence, lest unawares we lose</div>
<div class="t0">This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.</div>
</div>

<p>It is unnecessary to quote more of the speeches
in Heaven; they are tangles of Scriptural phrase,
<span class="pb" id="pg_131">[131]</span>
from which there can be extracted neither good
divinity nor good humanity. "The glory of
God," says the Wisdom of Solomon, "is to conceal
a thing; the glory of the King is to find it
out." But the glory of Milton's Deity is to explain
a thing. The proud voluble candour of
some of these speeches reminds us only of the
author of <i>A Defence of the People of England</i>.
In some of them there is even a flavour of
uneasy boastfulness, as of one who is anxious
not to be lessened in the estimation of the rebel
adversary.</p>

<p>It may be pleaded that the epical necessities of
the poem imposed finite conceptions, of one sort
or another, upon Milton; and that, when once he
had begun to define and explain, he was carried
further and further along that perilous way without
being fully conscious of whither he was tending.
Yet his persistent accumulation of harsh and
dread traits seems wilful in its nature; he bases
his description, no doubt, on hints from Scripture,
but he pays no attention to any that do not fall in
with his own narrow and gloomy conception.
Satan is permitted to rise from the burning lake--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">That with reiterated crimes he might</div>
<div class="t0">Heap on himself damnation.</div>
</div>

<p>When he arrives at the foot of the stairway that
joins Heaven and the World--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_132">[132]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">The stairs were then let down, whether to dare</div>
<div class="t0">The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate</div>
<div class="t0">His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss.</div>
</div>

<p>Astronomy, it is suggested by "the affable Archangel,"
has perhaps been made a difficult subject in
order to produce the droll fallacies of astronomers:</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t7">He his fabric of the Heavens</div>
<div class="t0">Hath left to their disputes--perhaps to move</div>
<div class="t0">His laughter at their quaint opinions wide.</div>
</div>

<p>And this conjecture is borne out by what happened
when the builders of the tower of Babel were
frustrated, for then--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t7">Great laughter was in Heaven,</div>
<div class="t0">And looking down to see the hubbub strange</div>
<div class="t0">And hear the din.</div>
</div>

<p>Milton, in short, has hardened the heart of
the God that hardened Pharaoh's heart, and has
narrowed his love and his power.</p>

<p>Some kind of internal blindness must have
visited him if he did not perceive what must inevitably
be the effect of all this on the sympathies
and interest of the reader. And the irony of the
thing is that his own sympathies were not proof
against the trial that he had devised for them. He
lavished all his power, all his skill, and, in spite of
himself, the greater part of his sympathy, on the
splendid figure of Satan. He avoids calling <i>Paradise Lost</i>
<span class="pb" id="pg_133">[133]</span>
"an heroic poem"; when it was printed,
in 1667, the title-page ran merely--<i>Paradise Lost,
A Poem in Ten Books</i>. Had he inserted the word
"heroic," the question as to who is the hero would
have been broached at once. And to that question,
if it be fairly faced, only one answer can be
given,--the answer that has already been given by
Dryden and Goethe, by Lord Chesterfield and
Professor Masson. It was not for nothing that
Milton stultified the professed moral of his poem,
and emptied it of all spiritual content. He was
not fully conscious, it seems, of what he was doing;
but he builded better than he knew. A profound
poetic instinct taught him to preserve epic truth
at all costs. And the epic value of <i>Paradise Lost</i> is
centred in the character and achievements of Satan.</p>

<p>Satan unavoidably reminds us of Prometheus,
and although there are essential differences, we are
not made to feel them essential. His very situation
as the fearless antagonist of Omnipotence
makes him either a fool or a hero, and Milton is
far indeed from permitting us to think him a fool.
The nobility and greatness of his bearing are
brought home to us in some half-dozen of the
finest poetic passages in the world. The most
stupendous of the poet's imaginative creations are
made the foil for a greater than themselves. Was
ever terror more magnificently embodied than in
the phantom figure of Death?--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_134">[134]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t10">The other Shape--</div>
<div class="t0">If shape it might be called that shape had none</div>
<div class="t0">Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb;</div>
<div class="t0">Or substance might be called that shadow seemed,</div>
<div class="t0">For each seemed either--black it stood as Night,</div>
<div class="t0">Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,</div>
<div class="t0">And shook a dreadful dart: what seemed his head</div>
<div class="t0">The likeness of a kingly crown had on.</div>
<div class="t0">Satan was now at hand, and from his seat</div>
<div class="t0">The monster moving onward came as fast</div>
<div class="t0">With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode.</div>
</div>

<p>This is the passage that drew from Burke a rapture
of praise. But as it stands in the poem its elevation
is a scaffolding merely, whence we may view
the greatness of Satan:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">The undaunted Fiend what this might be admired--</div>
<div class="t0">Admired, not feared (God and his Son except,</div>
<div class="t0">Created thing naught valued he nor shunned).</div>
</div>

<p>The same magnificent effect of suggestion is
wrought even more subtly in the scene where
Satan approaches</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">the throne</div>
<div class="t0">Of <i>Chaos</i>, and his dark pavilion spread</div>
<div class="t0">Wide on the wasteful Deep.</div>
</div>

<p>Courteously and fearlessly Satan addresses himself
to the monarch of the nethermost abyss. His
speech contains no threats; he asks guidance in
his quest; and, with politic forethought, promises
that that quest, if successful, shall restore an outlying
lost province to Chaos. There is nothing
<span class="pb" id="pg_135">[135]</span>
in his words to cause consternation; but the King
is afraid:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t10">Him thus the anarch old,</div>
<div class="t0">With faltering speech and visage incomposed,</div>
<div class="t0">Answered:--"I know thee, stranger, who thou art--</div>
<div class="t0">That mighty leading Angel, who of late</div>
<div class="t0">Made head against Heaven's King, though overthrown."</div>
</div>

<p>In the war on the plains of Heaven Satan ranges
up and down the fighting line, like Cromwell;
he fortifies his comrades to endurance, and encourages
them to attack. In Hell he stands like
a tower:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t7">His form had yet not lost</div>
<div class="t0">All her original brightness, nor appeared</div>
<div class="t0">Less than Archangel ruined, and the excess</div>
<div class="t0">Of glory obscured.</div>
</div>

<p>In his contests with Michael in Heaven and with
Gabriel on Earth he never falls below himself:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t8">"If I must contend," said he,</div>
<div class="t0">"Best with the best--the sender, not the sent;</div>
<div class="t0">Or all at once."</div>
</div>

<p>But his motive passions, it is objected, were
envy, ambition, and hate, and his end was a crime.
To which objection a modern poet has replied
that a crime will serve as a measure for the spirit.
Certainly to Satan there could never be imputed
the sin of "the unlit lamp and the ungirt loin."
And Milton has not left him devoid of the
gentlest passion, the passion of pity:--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_136">[136]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t11">Cruel his eye, but cast</div>
<div class="t0">Signs of remorse and passion, to behold</div>
<div class="t0">The fellows of his crime, the followers rather</div>
<div class="t0">(Far other once beheld in bliss), condemned</div>
<div class="t0">For ever now to have their lot in pain--</div>
<div class="t0">Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced</div>
<div class="t0">Of Heaven, and from eternal splendours flung</div>
<div class="t0">For his revolt--yet faithful how they stood,</div>
<div class="t0">Their glory withered.</div>
</div>

<p>Thrice he attempts to address them, and thrice--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t7">in spite of scorn</div>
<div class="t0">Tears, such as Angels weep, burst forth.</div>
</div>

<p>His followers are devotedly attached to him;
they admire him "that for the general safety he
despised his own"; and the only scene of rejoicing
recorded in the annals of Hell, before the
Fall of Man, is at the dissolution of the Stygian
Council, when the devils come forth "rejoicing
in their matchless Chief."</p>

<p>As if of set purpose to raise Satan high above
the heads of the other Archangels, Milton devises
a pair of similar scenes, in Heaven and in Hell.
In the one Satan takes upon himself the unknown
dangers of the enterprise that has been approved
by the assembly. In the other, which occurs in
the very next book, the Heavenly Powers are
addressed from the Throne, and asked--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">"Which of ye will be mortal, to redeem</div>
<div class="t0">Man's mortal crime, and just, the unjust to save?</div>
<span class="pb" id="pg_137">[137]</span>
<div class="t0">Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?"</div>
<div class="t">He asked, but all the Heavenly Quire stood mute,</div>
<div class="t0">And silence was in Heaven: on Man's behalf</div>
<div class="t0">Patron or intercessor none appeared--</div>
<div class="t0">Much less that durst upon his own head draw</div>
<div class="t0">The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.</div>
</div>

<p>No wonder that Landor--although in another
place he declares that Adam is the hero of <i>Paradise
Lost</i>, and that "there is neither truth nor wit"
in giving that name to Satan--is nevertheless
startled by this passage into the comment, "I
know not what interest Milton could have had in
making Satan so august a creature, and so ready
to share the dangers and sorrows of the angels he
had seduced. I know not, on the other hand,
what could have urged him to make the better
ones so dastardly that even at the voice of their
Creator not one among them offered his service to
rescue from eternal perdition the last and weakest
of intellectual beings."</p>

<p>When Satan first comes in sight of Paradisal
bliss and the new-created pair, here surely was a
chance for attributing to him the foul passions of
envy and hate unalloyed? On the contrary, he is
struck with admiration for their grace and infused
divinity. He could love and pity them--so he
muses--though himself unpitied. He seeks
alliance with them, and is prepared to give them a
share in all he has--which, it must be allowed, is
<span class="pb" id="pg_138">[138]</span>
the spirit of true hospitality. He feels it beneath
him to attack innocence and helplessness, but
public reasons compel him to do what otherwise
he would abhor:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">So spake the Fiend, and with necessity,</div>
<div class="t0">The tyrant's plea, excused his devilish deeds.</div>
</div>

<p>But no imputation is cast on the sincerity of the
plea, and we are left to conceive of Satan as of a
lover of beauty reluctantly compelled to shatter it
in the pursuit of his high political aims. In the
same way, when he finds Eve alone, on the morning
of the temptation, he is disarmed by her beauty
and innocence, and, for a spell, is struck "stupidly
good." Truly, Adam might boast, with Gibbon,
that he fell by a noble hand.</p>

<p>It is possible that by the time he had completed
the Fourth Book, Milton became uneasy as to
the effect he was producing. Up to that point
magnanimity and courage had been almost the
monopoly of Satan. He had been the Great
Dissenter, the undaunted and considerate leader of
an outcast minority. But now, in the description
of the war in Heaven, there came a chance of
doing something to right the balance. Milton
makes the most of the episode of Abdiel, who has
been led away with the rest of Satan's followers,
upon false pretences, and who, when he discovers
the true purpose of the expedition, makes a lonely
stand for the right:--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_139">[139]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Among the faithless faithful only he; ...</div>
<div class="t0">Nor number nor example with him wrought</div>
<div class="t0">To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,</div>
<div class="t0">Though single.</div>
</div>

<p>And Abdiel, when he meets Satan again after the
outbreak of the war, glories in his nonconformity,
and hisses out defiance:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">Thou seest</div>
<div class="t0">All are not of thy train; there be who faith</div>
<div class="t0">Prefer, and piety to God, though then</div>
<div class="t0">To thee not visible when I alone</div>
<div class="t0">Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent</div>
<div class="t0">From all: my Sect thou seest; now learn too late</div>
<div class="t0">How few sometimes may know when thousands err.</div>
</div>

<p>In this way Milton attempted to allay his
scruples, and to divide the honours of dissent.
Later on, after the Fall, when Satan returns to
Hell with tidings of his exploit, the change of all
the devils to serpents, and of their applause to "a
dismal universal hiss" was perhaps devised to cast
a slur upon the success of his mission. Some
critics have professed to discern a certain progressive
degradation and shrinkage in Satan as
the poem proceeds. But his original creation
lived on in the imagination and memory of
Milton, and was revived, with an added pathos,
in <i>Paradise Regained</i>. The most moving of all
Satan's speeches is perhaps the long pleading there
made in answer to the challenge of Christ, and
<span class="pb" id="pg_140">[140]</span>
its tone of unutterable despair is deepened by the
terrible severity of the speech made in answer.</p>

<p>The other leaders of the rebel troops take little
part in the action outside the scene of the Infernal
Council. In his memories of the Long Parliament
Milton could easily find examples of the
types he has embodied under the names of Belial,
Mammon, Moloch, and Beelzebub. Nor has he
forgotten the Westminster Assembly of divines.
The precise employments of that historic body
are described by him as the recreation of the lost
spirits:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Others apart sat on a hill retired,</div>
<div class="t0">In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high</div>
<div class="t0">Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate--</div>
<div class="t0">Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute--</div>
<div class="t0">And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.</div>
</div>

<p>It ill became Milton to cast contempt on these
reasonings, seeing that a whole system of them
was necessary for the argument of his poem. He
is so little of a philosopher that he seems hardly
to be conscious of the difficulties of his own
theory. Both in <i>Paradise Lost</i> and in the <i>Treatise
of Christian Doctrine</i> he enlarges with much
dogmatism and some arrogance on the difference
between foreknowledge and foreordination. He
rejects predestination decisively, but he not only
does not answer, he does not even so much as
mention, the difficulty that arises in attempting
<span class="pb" id="pg_141">[141]</span>
to distinguish between what is foreordained by
Omniscience and what is foreknown by Omnipotence.
Pope compared some of the speeches
delivered in Heaven to the arguments of a
"School-divine." The comparison does injustice
to the scholastic philosophers. There was never
one of them who could have walked into a
metaphysical bramble-bush with the blind recklessness
that Milton displays.</p>

<p>It is time to return to Eden and its inhabitants.
They have little to do but "to lop and prune and
prop and bind," to adore their Maker, and to
avoid the prohibited tree. It would perhaps have
been impossible for a poet with more dramatic
genius than Milton to make these favourites of
Heaven interesting in their happy state, while yet
the key that was to admit them to our world of
adventure and experience, of suffering and achievement,
hung untouched on a tree. And Adam,
from the wealth of his inexperience, is lavishly
sententious; when anything is to do, even if it is
only to go to sleep, he does it in a high style, and
makes a speech. Milton plainly saw the danger
of arousing a sense of incongruity and ludicrous
disproportion from the contest between these
harmless tame creatures and the great forces of
Satan's empire. So he makes man strong in
innocence, and, unlike the fallen angels, exempt
from all physical pain or wound. He even goes
<span class="pb" id="pg_142">[142]</span>
so far as to make Satan afraid of Adam, of his
heroic build and intellectual power. This last, it
might be said, is a fear not explained by anything
that we are privileged to hear from the lips of
Adam himself; but perhaps, in the case of our
great ancestor, we shall do well to remember
Hamlet's advice to the players, "Follow that lord,
and look you mock him not."</p>

<p>There remains a more important person--Eve.
And with Eve, since the beginning of Milton
criticism, there enter all those questions concerning
the comparative worthiness and the relative
authority of husband and wife which critics of
Milton so often and so gladly step aside to discuss.
Every one knows the line:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">He for God only, she for God in him.</div>
</div>

<p>Almost every one knows the lines:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t4">Nothing lovelier can be found</div>
<div class="t0">In woman than to study household good,</div>
<div class="t0">And good works in her husband to promote.</div>
</div>

<p>Milton certainly shared the views of Knox
concerning the "Monstrous Regiment of Women."
It is unnecessary to meet him on his own ground,
or to attempt a theory that shall explain or control
Eve, Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, Catherine of the
Medici, Mary Powell, and others of their sex. Such
theories prove only that man is a generalising and
<span class="pb" id="pg_143">[143]</span>
rationalising animal. The poet brought his fate
on himself, for since Eve was the mother of mankind,
he thought fit to make her the embodiment
of a doctrine. But he also (a thing of far deeper
interest) coloured his account by the introduction
of personal memories and feelings. Of Eve, at
least, he never writes indifferently. When he came
to write <i>Samson Agonistes</i>, the intensity of his
feelings concerning Dalila caused him to deviate
from the best Greek tradition and to assign
inappropriate matter to the Chorus. And even in
his matter-of-fact <i>History of Britain</i>, the name of
Boadicea awakens him to a fit of indignation with
the Britons who upheld her rule. There is full
scope in <i>Paradise Lost</i> for similar expressions of
indignation. Adam, after the Fall, speaks of his
wife as</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Not to be trusted--longing to be seen</div>
<div class="t0">Though by the Devil himself.</div>
</div>

<p>In the Eleventh Book the daughters of men are
described as bred only</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">to sing, to dance,</div>
<div class="t0">To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye.</div>
</div>

<p>But Milton, it is sometimes forgotten, was also the
author of that beautiful eulogy of Eve in the
Eighth Book:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">When I approach</div>
<div class="t0">Her loveliness, so absolute she seems</div>
<div class="t0">And in herself complete, so well to know</div>
<span class="pb" id="pg_144">[144]</span>
<div class="t0">Her own, that what she wills to do or say</div>
<div class="t0">Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best.</div>
<div class="t0">All higher Knowledge in her presence falls</div>
<div class="t0">Degraded; Wisdom in discourse with her</div>
<div class="t0">Loses, discountenanced, and like Folly shows;</div>
<div class="t0">Authority and Reason on her wait,</div>
<div class="t0">As one intended first, not after made</div>
<div class="t0">Occasionally; and, to consummate all,</div>
<div class="t0">Greatness of mind and nobleness their seat</div>
<div class="t0">Build in her loveliest, and create an awe</div>
<div class="t0">About her, as a guard angelic placed.</div>
</div>

<p>It is an exact parallel to Florizel's praise of
Perdita in <i>The Winter's Tale</i>:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">When you speak, sweet,</div>
<div class="t0">I'd have you do it ever: when you sing,</div>
<div class="t0">I'd have you buy and sell so, so give alms,</div>
<div class="t0">Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,</div>
<div class="t0">To sing them too; when you do dance, I wish you</div>
<div class="t0">A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do</div>
<div class="t0">Nothing but that; move still, still so,</div>
<div class="t0">And own no other function: each your doing,</div>
<div class="t0">So singular in each particular,</div>
<div class="t0">Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,</div>
<div class="t0">That all your acts are queens.</div>
</div>

<p>But Florizel addresses his praise to the lady herself;
while Adam, who had never been young, confides
it in private to Raphael, after dinner, and studies
a more instructive and authoritative strain in his
conversations with Eve. And now comes a point
worthy of remark. The Angel, to whom, it
cannot be doubted, Milton committed the exposition
<span class="pb" id="pg_145">[145]</span>
of his own views, after hearing this confession,
frowns, and administers a tart reproof. He
describes Eve, somewhat grudgingly, as "an outside--fair,
no doubt," and peremptorily teaches
Adam the duties of self-appreciation and self-assertion:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t10">Oft-times nothing profits more</div>
<div class="t0">Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right</div>
<div class="t0">Well managed. Of that skill the more thou know'st,</div>
<div class="t0">The more she will acknowledge thee her head,</div>
<div class="t0">And to realities yield all her shows.</div>
</div>

<p>And in the sequel, Adam bitterly laments that he
had failed to profit by this advice. He might
have been comforted by the wisdom of Chaucer's
Franklin:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">When maistrie cometh, the god of love anon</div>
<div class="t0">Beteth his wynges and, farewel, he is gon!</div>
</div>

<p>The explanation of all this is clear to see.
Milton was not, as he has sometimes been described,
a callous and morose Puritan. He was
extraordinarily susceptible to the attractions of
feminine beauty and grace. Adam's confession is
his own. But the ideal of character that he had put
before himself caused him passionately to resent
this susceptibility. It was the joint in his harness,
the main breach in his Stoicism, the great anomaly
in a life regulated as for his Task-master. He
felt that beauty was a power not himself, unbalancing
and disturbing the rational self-centred
<span class="pb" id="pg_146">[146]</span>
poise of his soul. There have been poets whose
service of Venus Verticordia was whole-hearted.
But to Milton the power of Beauty was a
magnetism to be distrusted for its very strength.
He felt something of what he makes Satan express,
that there is terror in love and beauty "not
approached by stronger hate." The Chorus in
<i>Samson Agonistes</i> makes a similar observation:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Yet beauty, though injurious, hath strange power</div>
<div class="t0">After offence returning, to regain</div>
<div class="t0">Love once possessed.</div>
</div>

<p>To escape from the dominion of the tyrant is the
duty of a wise man. When Raphael remarked
that "Love ... hath his seat in Reason, and is
judicious," he committed himself to a statement
which a longer experience of the world would have
enabled him to correct. But Milton wished it
true; and perhaps even lured himself into a
belief of its truth. At any rate, when Satan, in
<i>Paradise Regained</i>, expounds his opinion on the
matter, it is found, for once, to be in substantial
agreement with Raphael's:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">Beauty stands</div>
<div class="t0">In the admiration only of weak minds</div>
<div class="t0">Led captive; cease to admire, and all her plumes</div>
<div class="t0">Fall flat, and shrink into a trivial toy,</div>
<div class="t0">At every sudden slighting quite abashed.</div>
</div>

<p>It is a great loss to literature that Mrs.
<span class="pb" id="pg_147">[147]</span>
Millamant, the delightful heroine of Congreve's
comedy, was no reader of Milton. Her favourite
author was Suckling:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">I prithee spare me, gentle boy,</div>
<div class="t0">Press me no more for that slight toy,</div>
<div class="t0">That foolish trifle of a heart.</div>
</div>

<p>If she had a copy of the <i>Paradise Regained</i>,
doubtless it stood in some conspicuous place, and
was never opened,--like Mrs. Wishfort's "books
over the chimney--Quarles and Prynne, and 'The
Short View of the Stage,' with Bunyan's works, to
entertain you." But all unawares she has answered
the contention of Satan:--"O the vanity of these
men!--Fainall, d'ye hear him? If they did not
commend us, we were not handsome! Now you
must know that they could not commend one, if
one was not handsome. Beauty the lover's gift!--Lord,
what is a lover, that it can give? ... One
no more owes one's beauty to a lover than one's
wit to an echo."</p>

<p>Like most men of an impressionable temperament
and a strong will, Milton was not sympathetic,
nor curious to place himself where he might see the
world from a point of view other than his own.
Besieged by their sensations and impressions, concerned
above all things with maintaining their
opinions and enforcing their beliefs on others, such
men find enough to do within the citadel of their
<span class="pb" id="pg_148">[148]</span>
own personality. To judge from some passages
of his works, one half of the human race was to
Milton an illusion to which the other half was
subject. One who is in love with his own ideas
cannot but be disappointed alike with existing
institutions and with the tissue of surprises that is
a person. Milton's disappointment, which had
inspired the early Divorce pamphlets, finds renewed
expression in Adam's prophecy of unhappy
marriages--a notable parallel to the similar
prophecy in <i>Venus and Adonis</i>--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">For either</div>
<div class="t0">He never shall find out fit mate, but such</div>
<div class="t0">As some misfortune brings him, or mistake;</div>
<div class="t0">Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain,</div>
<div class="t0">Through her perverseness, but shall see her gained</div>
<div class="t0">By a far worse; or, if she love, withheld</div>
<div class="t0">By parents; or his happiest choice too late</div>
<div class="t0">Shall meet, already linked and wedlock-bound</div>
<div class="t0">To a fell adversary, his hate or shame.</div>
</div>

<p>But, with all this, of our two grand parents Eve
is the better drawn and the more human. Milton
did not intend that it should be so, but he could
not help it. One consequence of the doctrine--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">He for God only, she for God in him--</div>
</div>

<p>is that Adam's single impulse of unselfishness,
whereby he elects to share the offence and
punishment of Eve, is a vice in him, a "bad compliance."
<span class="pb" id="pg_149">[149]</span>
Self-abnegation, the duty of Eve, is
hardly within the right of Adam; and Dr. Johnson
expressed a half-truth in violently paradoxical
terms when he said that Milton "thought woman
made only for obedience and man only for
rebellion." It would be truer, and weaker, to say
that Milton thought woman made for the exercise
of private, and man for the exercise of public,
virtues. Hence in their mutual relations Eve
carries off all the honours, for her duty towards
Adam coincides with her inclination, while in his
case the two are at variance. There is no speech
of Adam's to be matched with the pleading
intensity of Eve's appeal, beginning--"Forsake
me not thus, Adam!"--and to her Milton commits
the last and best speech spoken in Paradise:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">But now lead on;</div>
<div class="t0">In me is no delay; with thee to go</div>
<div class="t0">Is to stay here; without thee here to stay</div>
<div class="t0">Is to go hence unwilling; thou to me</div>
<div class="t0">Art all things under Heaven, all places thou,</div>
<div class="t0">Who for my wilful crime art banished hence.</div>
</div>

<p>She is generous and loving; her only reproach
addressed to Adam is that he acceded to her request,
and permitted her, on that fateful morning, to do
her gardening alone, among the roses and myrtles.
She is a fair companion picture to set over against
Dalila, and is utterly incapable of Dalila's hypocrisy
in justifying private treachery by reasons of public
<span class="pb" id="pg_150">[150]</span>
policy. There is even a certain dramatic development
in her character; after she has eaten of the
fruit, audacity and deceit appear in her reflections;
she meditates withholding from Adam the advantages
of the tree, in order that she may become--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t4">More equal, and perhaps--</div>
<div class="t0">A thing not undesirable--sometimes</div>
<div class="t0">Superior.</div>
</div>

<p>It is easy to understand how tired Eve might well
become (even before the fallacious fruit was tasted)
of Adam's carefully maintained superiority. On
thinking, however, of the judgment that she may
have to suffer, and of her own death, she resolves
to draw him in, her motive being not fear, but a
sudden movement of jealousy at the thought of--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Adam wedded to another Eve.</div>
</div>

<p>This is as near an approach to drama in the handling
of a human situation as is to be found in all
<i>Paradise Lost</i>.</p>

<p>But enough of this vein of criticism, which is
justified only by the pleasure of detecting Milton
too imperfectly concealed behind his handiwork.
To treat the scenes he portrays as if analysis of
character were his aim, and truth of psychology
his touchstone, is to do a wrong to the artist. He
is an epic, not a dramatic, poet; to find him at his
best we must look at those passages of unsurpassed
magnificence wherein he describes some noble or
<span class="pb" id="pg_151">[151]</span>
striking attitude, some strong or majestic action,
in its outward physical aspect.</p>

<p>In this, the loftiest part of his task, his other
defects, as if by some hidden law of compensation,
are splendidly redeemed. While he deals with
abstract thought or moral truth his handling is
tight, pedantic, and disagreeably hard. But when
he comes to describe his epic personages and his
embodied visions, all is power, and vagueness, and
grandeur. His imagination, escaped from the
narrow prison of his thought, rises like a vapour,
and, taking shape before his eyes, proclaims itself
his master.</p>

<p>No other poet has known so well how to portray,
in a few strokes, effects of multitude and vastness.
Now it is the sacred congregation in Heaven:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">About him all the Sanctities of Heaven</div>
<div class="t0">Stood thick as stars, and from his sight received</div>
<div class="t0">Beatitude past utterance.</div>
</div>

<p>Now the warrior host of Hell:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">He spake; and, to confirm his words, outflew</div>
<div class="t0">Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs</div>
<div class="t0">Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze</div>
<div class="t0">Far round illumined Hell.</div>
</div>

<p>In these, as in other like scenes, he preserves epic
unity by throwing the whole into the distance.
So after the approach of the Messiah to battle,
"the poet," says Coleridge, "by one touch from
<span class="pb" id="pg_152">[152]</span>
himself--'far off their coming shone!'--makes the
whole one image." He describes at a greater range
of vision than any other poet: the frame-work
of his single scenes is often not less than a third
of universal space. When he has added figure to
figure in the endeavour to picture the multitudinous
disarray of the fallen Angels on the lake, one line
suffices to reduce the whole spectacle to its due
dimensions beneath that cavernous tent of darkness:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">He called so loud that all the hollow deep</div>
<div class="t0">Of Hell resounded.</div>
</div>

<p>The same effect of number and vastness, diminished
and unified by the same reference to a larger
setting, wherein all is seen at a glance, may be
noted in the description of the raising of Satan's
standard in Hell:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">The imperial ensign, which, full high advanced,</div>
<div class="t0">Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind,</div>
<div class="t0">With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed,</div>
<div class="t0">Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while</div>
<div class="t0">Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds:</div>
<div class="t0">At which the universal host up-sent</div>
<div class="t0">A shout that tore Hell's concave, and beyond</div>
<div class="t0">Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.</div>
<div class="t0">All in a moment through the gloom were seen</div>
<div class="t0">Ten thousand banners rise into the air,</div>
<div class="t0">With orient colours waving: with them rose</div>
<div class="t0">A forest huge of spears; and thronging helms</div>
<div class="t0">Appeared, and serried shields in thick array</div>
<div class="t0">Of depth immeasureable.</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_153">[153]</div>

<p>Sometimes a line or two gives him scope enough
for the rendering of one of these epic scenes,
immense and vivid. The ruin and prostration of
the rebels is made visible in two lines:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood</div>
<div class="t0">With scattered arms and ensigns.</div>
</div>

<p>And the picture of the East rises at a touch:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Dusk faces with white silken turbants wreathed.</div>
</div>

<p>In the drawing of single attitudes Milton
studies the same large decorum and majesty. He
is never tempted into detail in the describing of
gesture or action; never loses the whole in the
part. The bulk of <i>Paradise Lost</i> was written
between the sixth and the thirteenth years of his
blindness. Since the veil had fallen he had lived
with the luminous shapes that he could picture
against the dark. The human face had lost, in
his recollection of it, something of its minuter
delineation, but nothing of its radiance. On the
other hand, the human figure, in its most significant
gestures and larger movements, haunted his
visions. His description of the appearance of the
wife whom he had never seen is an early model of
many of his later drawings. She comes to his bedside
and leans over him, stretching forth her arms:</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Her face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight</div>
<div class="t0">Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined</div>
<div class="t0">So clear as in no face with more delight.</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_154">[154]</div>

<p>Adam and Eve, as they are first seen in Paradise,
have the same shining quality, the same vagueness
of beauty expressing itself in purely emotional
terms. Satan standing on the top of Mount
Niphates, looking down on Eden spread out at his
feet, and then with fierce gesticulation addressing
himself to the sun at the zenith, is one of the dim
solitary figures that dwell in the mind's eye. No
less impressive and no less indefinite are those two
monumental descriptions of the rebel leader; the
first, of his going forth to war in Heaven:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">High in the midst, exalted as a God,</div>
<div class="t0">The Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat,</div>
<div class="t0">Idol of majesty divine, enclosed</div>
<div class="t0">With flaming Cherubim and golden shields.</div>
</div>

<p>and the other, of his encounter with Gabriel:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t10">Satan, alarmed,</div>
<div class="t0">Collecting all his might, dilated stood,</div>
<div class="t0">Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved:</div>
<div class="t0">His stature reached the sky, and on his crest</div>
<div class="t0">Sat Horror plumed; nor wanted in his grasp</div>
<div class="t0">What seemed both spear and shield.</div>
</div>

<p>In these, and in a hundred other notable passages,
the images are as simple and broad as the emotional
effects that they produce,--the sun, flame, gold, a
mountain, the sky.</p>

<p>Some of the scenes and situations delineated by
Milton are of a gentler and more elusive virtue
<span class="pb" id="pg_155">[155]</span>
than these terrors and sublimities. His descriptions
of morning and evening are always charged
with emotion--the quiet coming-on of night in
Eden; or the break of day in the wilderness of
the Temptation, with a sense of joy and relief
"after a night of storm so ruinous." His feeling
for the imaginative effects of architecture in a
landscape is extraordinarily subtle. One, at least,
of these effects is hardly to be experienced among
the hedgerows and farmsteads and placid rambling
towns of England. Travellers in Italy, or in the
East, are better able to understand the transfiguration
of a landscape by the distant view of a small
compact array of walls and towers perched on a
vantage-ground among the hills of the horizon.
The lawlessness of Nature, the homelessness of the
surface of the earth, and the fears that haunt uninhabited
places, are all accentuated by the distrust
that frowns from the battlements of such a stronghold
of militant civility. For this reason, perhaps,
the architectural features in certain pictures and
drawings have an indescribable power of suggestion.
The city, self-contained and fortified, overlooking
a wide expanse of country, stands for safety and
society; the little group of figures, parleying at
the gate, or moving down into the plain, awakens
in the mind a sense of far-off things,--the moving
accidents of the great outer world, and the dangers
and chances of the unknown. Bunyan, whose
<span class="pb" id="pg_156">[156]</span>
imagination was nourished on the Eastern scenery
and sentiment of the Bible, shows himself powerfully
affected by situations of this kind, as where,
in the beginning of the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, he
describes the man with his face from his own home,
running from the City of Destruction, and the
group of his kindred calling after him to return:--"but
the man put his fingers in his ears, and ran
on crying, Life, Life, Eternal Life: so he looked
not behind him, but fled towards the middle of
the plain."</p>

<p>Such another figure is Milton's Abdiel, who
escaped from the rebel citadel--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">And with retorted scorn his back he turned</div>
<div class="t0">On those proud towers, to swift destruction doomed.</div>
</div>

<p>The perils of his flight are vaguely indicated by
a few admirable touches in the opening of the next
Book:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">All night the dreadless Angel, unpursued,</div>
<div class="t0">Through Heaven's wide champaign held his way, till Morn</div>
<div class="t0">Waked by the circling Hours, with rosy hand</div>
<div class="t0">Unbarred the gates of Light.</div>
</div>

<p>A more signal instance of the same poetic
effect is to be found in the wonderful close of
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, where Adam and Eve are led
down from the garden by the archangel Michael,
and are left standing in the vast plain below:--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_157">[157]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld</div>
<div class="t0">Of Paradise, so late their happy seat,</div>
<div class="t0">Waved over by that flaming brand; the gate</div>
<div class="t0">With dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms.</div>
<div class="t0">Some natural tears they dropped, but wiped them soon;</div>
<div class="t0">The world was all before them, where to choose</div>
<div class="t0">Their place of rest, and Providence their guide.</div>
<div class="t0">They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow,</div>
<div class="t0">Through Eden took their solitary way.</div>
</div>

<p>Criticism might exhaust itself in the effort to
do justice to the beauty of this close. Of Adam
and Eve it may be truly said that none of all
their doings in the garden became them like the
leaving of it. Yet Addison and Bentley, the
ornaments of a polite and learned age, are at one
in their depreciation of the last two lines.
Addison, after a formal apology for "the smallest
Alteration in this divine Work," boldly recommends
amputation; while Bentley, with the
caution of a more experienced surgeon, offers to
crutch the lines on certain wooden contrivances of
his own. The three epithets, "wandering,"
"slow," and "solitary," are all censured by him.
Our first parents, he remarks, were guided by
Providence, and therefore needed not to wander;
they were reassured by Michael's predictions, and
so might well display an engaging briskness;
while as for "their solitary way," they were no
more solitary than in Paradise, "there being no
Body besides Them Two, both here and there."
<span class="pb" id="pg_158">[158]</span>
He therefore suggests a distich more agreeable to
the general scheme:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Then hand in hand with social steps their way</div>
<div class="t0">Through Eden took, with Heav'nly Comfort cheer'd</div>
</div>

<p>It is impossible to answer such criticism; the
organs of human speech are too frail. Let
Bentley be left to contemplate with delight the
hideous gash that his chopper has inflicted on the
Miltonic rhythm of the last line. If Addison, for
his part, had been less concerned with the opinions
of M. Bossu, and the enumeration of the books
of the <i>&AElig;neid</i>, he might have found leisure
to notice that the two later poems, <i>Paradise
Regained</i> and <i>Samson Agonistes</i>, are each brought
to a close which exactly resembles the close of
<i>Paradise Lost</i>. After the splendours in the last
book of <i>Paradise Regained</i>--the fall of Satan,
"smitten with amazement," from the pinnacle of
the Temple, the elaborate classical comparisons of
Antaeus and the Sphinx, and the triumphal chorus
of Angels who bear the Son of God aloft with
anthems of victory--the poem ends with the same
exquisite lull:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t8">He, unobserved,</div>
<div class="t0">Home to his mother's house private returned.</div>
</div>

<p>And <i>Samson Agonistes</i> brings as glorious a triumph
to no less peaceful a close:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">And calm of mind, all passion spent.</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_159">[159]</div>

<p>The dying fall is the same in all three, and is the
form of ending preferred by the musical and
poetic genius of Milton.</p>

<p>Passages of a crowded and ostentatious magnificence
are more frequent in <i>Paradise Lost</i> than in
either of the two later poems. In <i>Paradise
Regained</i> and <i>Samson Agonistes</i> the enhanced
severity of a style which rejects almost all ornament
was due in part, no doubt, to a gradual
change in Milton's temper and attitude. It is not
so much that his power of imagination waned, as
that his interest veered, turning more to thought
and reflection, less to action and picture. In
these two poems, at the last, he celebrated that</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t7">better fortitude</div>
<div class="t0">Of patience and heroic martyrdom</div>
</div>

<p>which he had professed to sing in <i>Paradise Lost</i>.
We are told by his nephew that he "could not
bear with patience any such thing related to him"
as that <i>Paradise Regained</i> was inferior to <i>Paradise
Lost</i>. He was right; its merits and beauties are
of a different and more sombre kind, yet of a kind
perhaps further out of the reach of any other poet
than even the constellated glories of <i>Paradise
Lost</i> itself. It should be remembered that
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, although it was written by Milton
between the fiftieth and the fifty-seventh years of
his age, was conceived by him, in its main outlines,
<span class="pb" id="pg_160">[160]</span>
not later than his thirty-fourth year. Two of
the passages noticed above, where Satan addresses
himself to the Sun and where the Angel leads
Adam and Eve out of Paradise, embody situations
which had appealed to his younger imagination.
Some of the very words of Satan's address were
written, we learn from Phillips, about 1642. And
the expulsion of Adam and Eve seems to contain
a reminiscence of the time when Milton was considering
the history of Lot as a possible subject for
an epic. The lines--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">In either hand the hastening Angel caught</div>
<div class="t0">Our lingering parents--</div>
</div>

<p>were perhaps suggested by the Scripture narrative--"And
while he lingered, the men laid hold
upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife,...
and they brought him forth, and set him
without the city" (Genesis xix. 16).</p>

<p>The gravity and density of the style of
<i>Paradise Lost</i> would have been beyond the power
of youth, even of the youth of Milton; but the
action of the poem, with all its vividness and
vigour, could perhaps hardly have been first conceived
in mature age. The composition was long
deferred, so that in the decade which witnessed the
production of all three great poems we see a
strangely rapid development, or change rather, of
manner. In <i>Paradise Lost</i> Milton at last delivered
<span class="pb" id="pg_161">[161]</span>
himself of the work that had been brooding over
him "with mighty wings outspread" during all
the years of his manhood. But his imagination
could not easily emancipate itself from that overmastering
presence; and when he took up with a
fresh task he gladly chose a theme closely related
to the theme of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, and an opportunity
of re-introducing some of the ancient figures. A
kind-hearted, simple-minded, pig-headed young
Quaker, called Thomas Ellwood, takes to himself
credit for having suggested a sequel to the story of
the Fall. "Thou hast said much here," he remarked
to Milton, "of <i>Paradise Lost</i>; but what
hast thou to say of <i>Paradise Found</i>?" The
words, as it seemed to Ellwood, sank deep, and
did their work. "He made me no answer, but
sate some time in a muse, then brake off that discourse
and fell upon another subject." Perhaps
while he sat in a muse Milton was attempting to
sound, with the plummet of conjecture, the abyss
of human folly, "dark, wasteful, wild." So early
as in the fourth line of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, and already
very fully in the Third Book, he had treated of
<i>Paradise Found</i> as an integral part of his subject.
The episode of the Eleventh and Twelfth Books
was wholly concerned with it. It seems not
unlikely, however, that he caught at the suggestion
as an excuse for a new and independent work.
One of the commonest kinds of critical stupidity
<span class="pb" id="pg_162">[162]</span>
is the kind that discovers something "unfinished"
in a great work of art, and suggests desirable
trimmings and additions. Milton knew that
<i>Paradise Lost</i> was finished, in every sense. But
room had not been found in it for all that now
held the chief place in his matured thought.
When he chose the theme of his great work, the
actual temptation of man probably bulked much
larger in his design than it does in the completed
poem. His epic creatures, from being the
machinery of the poem, usurped a share of the
control. With all Milton's care and skill, there is
very little interest in the actual plucking of the
apple; Eve was too simple a pleader to make
much of the case for the defence. Yet human
life presented itself to Milton chiefly under the
guise of a series of temptations. The title of one
of Andrew Marvell's pieces might well be used to
describe the whole canon of his poetry, from
<i>L' Allegro</i> to <i>Samson Agonistes</i>--all are parts of <i>A
Dialogue between the Resolved Soul and Created
Pleasure</i>. To his youthful fancy Mirth and
Melancholy present themselves in the likeness of
rival goddesses, claiming allegiance, and offering
gifts. The story of Samson is a story of temptation,
yielded to through weakness, punished by
ignominy, and, in the end, magnificently expiated.
In <i>Comus</i> is shown how the temptations of created
pleasure may be resisted by the chastity of the
<span class="pb" id="pg_163">[163]</span>
"resolved soul." In <i>Paradise Lost</i>, however, the
resolved soul had somehow, failing Man, found
for itself a congenial habitation in the Devil.
The high and pure philosophy of the Lady and
her brothers has no counterpart in the later and
greater poem. Milton, therefore, willingly seized
on the suggestion made by Ellwood; and in
<i>Paradise Regained</i> exhibited at length, with every
variety of form and argument, the spectacle of--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t2">one man's firm obedience fully tried</div>
<div class="t0">Through all temptation, and the Tempter foiled</div>
<div class="t0">In all his wiles, defeated and repulsed</div>
</div>

<p>The subject of <i>Comus</i> is repeated; but in place
of the dazzling allurement of the senses which is
the temptation of the earlier poem, there is the
temptation of the will, the appeal made in vain
by Satan to those more strenuous and maturer
passions of pride, ambition, love of wealth, and
love of power. Instead of the innocent and
instinctive purity of the Lady, which unmasks the
fallacies of Comus, there is heard in <i>Paradise
Regained</i> the voice of a high Stoical philosophy,
strong in self-sufficiency, rich in illustrations drawn
from the experience of the ages, and attributed, by
this singular poet, to the Christ.</p>

<p>If his only purpose had been to make a worthy
epical counterpart to <i>Paradise Lost</i>, those critics
are doubtless right who think his chosen subject
<span class="pb" id="pg_164">[164]</span>
not altogether adequate to the occasion. The Fall
of Man is best matched by the Redemption of
Man--a subject which Milton, whether he knew
it or not, was particularly ill-qualified to treat.
It is sketched, hastily and prosaically, in the
Twelfth Book of <i>Paradise Lost</i>; but there is no
escaping from the conclusion that the central
mystery of the Christian religion occupied very
little space in Milton's scheme of religion and
thought. Had he chosen this subject, the account
given, in the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, of
the Descent into Hell might have furnished him
with rich material for one part of his theme. The
conquest of the upper world by Satan, narrated in
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, might have had for natural sequel
the triumphant descent into Hell of the King of
Glory, and the liberation of the captives. For
Milton's grandiose epical vein the theme has great
opportunities, as a brief summary of the Gospel of
Nicodemus will show:--</p>

<p>Karinus and Leucius, sons of Simeon, being
raised from the dead, write what occurred during
their sojourn in the realm of Hades: "While
we were lying, along with our fathers, in the
depth of the pit and in the uttermost darkness,
suddenly there appeared the golden hue of the
sun, and a purple royal light shining in upon us.
Then the father of all mankind and all the
patriarchs and prophets rejoiced, saying: 'That
<span class="pb" id="pg_165">[165]</span>
light is the author of everlasting light, who hath
promised to translate us to everlasting light.' And
Isaiah cried out, and said: 'This is the Light of
the Father, the Son of God, according to my
prophecy that I prophesied when I was alive upon
the earth, "The land of Zabulon, and the land
of Nephthalim, beyond Jordan; the people which
sat in darkness saw a great light, and to them
which sat in the region and shadow of death light
is sprung up." And now he has come, and has
shone upon us who are sitting in death.'</p>

<p>Then Simeon spoke in a like strain of exultation.
John the Baptist arrived, a herald of the
King of Glory; and Seth, at the bidding of Adam,
told how Michael the Archangel had refused him
oil from the tree of mercy for the anointing of
the body of Adam when he was sick, and had
comforted him with the assurance that when the
years should be fulfilled Adam would be raised up
again, and led into Paradise.</p>

<p>And even while the saints were rejoicing
there broke out dissension among the lords of
Hell. Satan, boasting of his latest exploit, told
Hades, the prince of Hell, how he had led Jesus
of Nazareth captive to death. But Hades was
ill satisfied and asked, 'Perchance this is the same
Jesus who by the word of his command took away
Lazarus after he had been four days in corruption,
whom I kept as dead?' And Satan answered and
<span class="pb" id="pg_166">[166]</span>
said, 'It is the same.' And when Hades heard
this he said to him, 'I adjure thee by thy powers
and mine, bring him not to me. For when I
heard the power of his word I trembled for fear,
and all my officers were struck with amazement.'
And while they were thus disputing, suddenly
there was a voice as of thunder, and a shouting as
of a multitude of spirits, saying, 'Lift up your
gates, O ye princes, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting
gates, and the King of Glory shall come in.'
Then Hades, hearing this, said to Satan, 'Depart
from me, and get thee out of my realm; if thou
art a powerful warrior, fight against the King of
Glory.' And he cast him forth from his habitations.</p>

<p>And while David and Isaiah were speaking,
recalling the words of their prophecy, there came
to Hell, in the form of a man, the Lord of
Majesty, and lighted up the eternal darkness, and
burst asunder the indissoluble chains, and seizing
Satan delivered him over to the power of Hades,
but Adam he drew with him to his brightness.</p>

<p>Then Hades receiving Satan reviled him
vehemently and said, 'O Prince of perdition, and
author of extermination, derision of angels and
scorn of the just, why didst thou do this thing?
All thy riches which thou hast acquired by the
tree of transgression and the loss of Paradise, thou
hast now lost by the tree of the cross, and all thy
joy has perished.'</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_167">[167]</div>

<p>But the Lord, holding Adam by the hand,
delivered him to Michael the Archangel, and all
the saints followed Michael the Archangel, and he
led them into Paradise, filled with mercy and
glory."</p>

<p>Milton would hardly have entertained for a
moment the idea of a subject taken from one of
the apocryphal gospels. And even if he had
felt no scruples on this point, the theme of the
Harrying of Hell would hardly have commended
itself to him in his later years, least of all its
triumphant close. His interest was now centred
rather in the sayings of the wise than in the deeds
of the mighty. The "crude apple that diverted
Eve" was indeed a simple theme compared with
the profound topics that are treated in <i>Samson
Agonistes</i>. The dark tangle of human life; the
inscrutable course of Divine providence; the
punishment so unwittingly and lightly incurred,
yet lying on a whole nation "heavy as frost, and
deep almost as life"; the temptation presenting
itself in the guise neither of pleasure, nor of
ambition, but of despair; and, through all, the
recurring assertion of unyielding trust and unflinching
acquiescence in the will of God; the
song of the Chorus--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Just are the ways of God</div>
<div class="t0">And justifiable to men--</div>
</div>

<p>finding an echo in Samson's declaration--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_168">[168]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Nothing of all these evils hath befallen me</div>
<div class="t0">But justly; I myself have brought them on;</div>
<div class="t0">Sole author I, sole cause;</div>
</div>

<p>--these together make up a theme where there is
no possible place for the gay theology of <i>Paradise
Lost</i>. The academic proof of God's justice, contained
in the earlier poem, if it were introduced
into <i>Samson Agonistes</i> could be met only with the
irony of Job: "Am I a sea, or a sea-monster,
that thou settest a watch over me?... What is
man, that thou shouldest magnify him, and that
thou shouldest set thine heart upon him, and that
thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try
him every moment?" The question has become
a real one; not to be answered now by the dogmatism
and dialectic of a system. Milton's bewilderment
and distress of mind are voiced in the
cry of the Chorus:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t3">Yet toward these thus dignified thou oft</div>
<div class="t3">Amidst their height of noon</div>
<div class="t0">Changest thy countenance, and thy hand with no regard</div>
<div class="t3">Of highest favours past</div>
<div class="t0">From thee or them, or them to thee of service.</div>
</div>

<p>And there follows their humble prayer, heard
and answered with Divine irony on the very day
of their asking:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">So deal not with this once thy glorious champion,</div>
<div class="t0">The image of thy strength and mighty minister.</div>
<div class="t0">What do I beg? How hast thou dealt already?</div>
<span class="pb" id="pg_169">[169]</span>
<div class="t0">Behold him in this state calamitous, and turn</div>
<div class="t0">His labours, for thou canst, to peaceful end.</div>
</div>

<p>In the days that now, as he looked back on his
youth and manhood, must have seemed to him both
distant and barren, Milton had sought for triumph,
in action and in argument. His seeking was
denied him; but he found peace, and the grace to
accept it.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_170">[170]</div>


<h2><a id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br />THE STYLE OF MILTON: METRE AND DICTION</a></h2>

<p>To approach the question of Milton's poetic style
thus late in the course of this treatise is to fall
into the absurdity of the famous art-critic, who,
lecturing on the Venus of Milo, devoted the last
and briefest of his lectures to the shape of that
noble work of art. In truth, since Milton died,
his name is become the mark, not of a biography
nor of a theme, but of a style--the most distinguished
in our poetry. But the task of literary
criticism is, at the best, a task of such disheartening
difficulty, that those who attempt it should be
humoured if they play long with the fringes of the
subject, and wait for courageous moments to attack
essentials.</p>

<p>In one sense, of course, and that not the least
important, the great works of Milton were the
product of the history and literatures of the world.
Cycles ferried his cradle. Generations guided him.
All forces were steadily employed to complete him.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_171">[171]</div>

<p>But when we attempt to separate the single
strands of his complex genealogy, to identify and
arrange the influences that made him, the essential
somehow escapes us. The genealogical method in
literary history is both interesting and valuable,
but we are too apt, in our admiration for its lucid
procedure, to forget that there is one thing which
it will never explain, and that thing is poetry.
Books beget books; but the mystery of conception
still evades us. We display, as if in a museum, all
the bits of thought and fragments of expression
that Milton may have borrowed from Homer and
Virgil, from Ariosto and Shakespeare. Here is a
far-fetched conceit, and there is an elaborately
jointed comparison. But these choice fragments
and samples were to be had by any one for the
taking; what it baffles us to explain is how they
came to be of so much more use to Milton than
ever they were to us. In any dictionary of quotations
you may find great thoughts and happy expressions
as plentiful and as cheap as sand, and,
for the most part, quite as useless. These are
dead thoughts: to catalogue, compare, and arrange
them is within the power of any competent literary
workman; but to raise them to blood-heat again,
to breathe upon them and vitalise them is the sign
that proclaims a poet. The ledger school of
criticism, which deals only with borrowings and
lendings, ingeniously traced and accurately recorded,
<span class="pb" id="pg_172">[172]</span>
looks foolish enough in the presence of this
miracle. There is a sort of critics who, in effect,
decry poetry, by fixing their attention solely on the
possessions that poetry inherits. They are like
Mammon--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t4">the least erected Spirit that fell</div>
<div class="t0">From Heaven; for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts</div>
<div class="t0">Were always downward bent, admiring more</div>
<div class="t0">The riches of Heaven's pavement, trodden gold,</div>
<div class="t0">Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed</div>
<div class="t0">In vision beatific.</div>
</div>

<p>With curious finger and thumb they pick holes in
the mosaic; and wherever there is wealth they are
always ready to cry "Thief!"</p>

<p>There is real interest in the enumeration of
Milton's borrowings, and in the citation of parallel
passages from the ancients to illustrate his work.
But since style is the expression of a living organism,
not a problem of cunning tesselation, it is permissible,
in this place, to pass over what he
borrowed from the ancients, in order to deal with
a more intimate matter, and to attempt a valuation
of that which he borrowed from no one, either
ancient or modern.</p>

<p>His indomitable personality and irrepressible
originality have left their stamp on all his work,
and have moulded his treatment, his handling, his
diction, his style. We, who have been inured
for centuries to Miltonic mouthings and mannerisms,
<span class="pb" id="pg_173">[173]</span>
are too likely to underestimate the degree
of his originality. Coleridge was probably wrong
when he said that "Shakespeare's poetry is
characterless; that is, it does not reflect the
individual Shakespeare." But he was unquestionably
right when he added that "John Milton
himself is in every line of <i>Paradise Lost</i>." The
more they are studied, the more do Milton's life
and his art seem to cohere, and to express the
pride and the power of his character.</p>

<p>Consider first his choice of subject. Ever since
the Renaissance had swept modern poetry back to
the pagan world, some voices of protest had been
raised, some swimmers, rather bold than strong, had
attempted to stem the tide. Among the earliest
of these was Thomas Sternhold, Groom of the
Chamber to King Henry the Eighth. Inspired perhaps
by the example of a better poet, Clement Marot,
Sternhold thrust some of the Psalms of David into
a carterly metre, "thinking thereby," says Anthony
&agrave; Wood, in his delightfully colloquial fashion,
"that the courtiers would sing them instead of
their sonnets, but did not, only some few excepted."
In the reign of Elizabeth, when the classical
mythology reigned and revelled in pageant and
masque, in court and town, one Thomas Brice, a
painful preacher, cried out against the pagan
fancies that had caught the English imagination
captive:--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_174">[174]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">We are not Ethnickes, we forsoth at least professe not so;</div>
<div class="t0">Why range we then to Ethnickes' trade? Come back, where will ye go?</div>
<div class="t0">Tel me, is Christe or Cupide lord? Doth God or Venus reign?</div>
</div>

<p>But he cried to deaf ears, and the Elizabethan age
produced no body of sacred poetry worth a record.
The beautiful metrical version of the Psalms,
made by Sir Philip Sidney and his sister, remained
in manuscript for centuries. Drayton's <i>Harmonie
of the Church</i> was suppressed. Robert Southwell,
whose lyrics on sacred subjects give him a unique
place among the poets of his age, joins in the oft-repeated
complaint:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Stil finest wits are 'stilling Venus' rose,</div>
<div class="t0">In Paynim toyes the sweetest vaines are spent;</div>
<div class="t0">To Christian workes few have their talents lent.</div>
</div>

<p>It was left for George Herbert and his contemporaries
to take up the attempt once more--this
time with better success--"to reprove the
vanity of those many love poems that are daily
writ and consecrated to Venus, and to bewail that
so few are writ that look towards God and
heaven."</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t8">Cannot thy dove</div>
<div class="t0">Outstrip their Cupid easily in flight?</div>
<div class="t">Or, since thy ways are deep, and still the same,</div>
<div class="t">Will not a verse run smooth that bears thy name?</div>
</div>

<p>But although Herbert and his successors, in their
<span class="pb" id="pg_175">[175]</span>
devotional lyrics, gave a whole new province to
English poetry, they left the idolatrous government
of the older provinces undisturbed. Dramatic
and narrative poetry went on in the old way, and
drew their inspiration from the old founts. Year
by year, as our native poetic wealth increased, it
became more and more difficult to break with the
past, and to lead poetry back to Zion. Nature
and precedent seemed allied against the innovation.
The worst of religious poetry, as Johnson more
than once pointed out, is its poverty of subject,
and its enforced chastity of treatment. You
cannot make a picture out of light alone; there
must be something to break it on. Then, too,
there was Shakespeare to be reckoned with: he
had written no hymns nor spiritual songs; among
the works of God, he had found man to be
deserving of his unremitting attention; yet, while
a certain monotony of manner afflicted the singers
of good and godly ballads, he had seemed never at
a loss for a subject, never at the end of the copious
inspiration that he drew from his unsanctified
themes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the seventeenth century, which
stirred so many questions in politics and criticism,
stirred this also; the fitness of sacred subjects for
heroic poetry was debated long and ardently both in
France and England, and many experiments were
made. These experiments belong, as might be
<span class="pb" id="pg_176">[176]</span>
expected, mainly to the time of the civil troubles.
It was then that the versifying of the Psalms
became a desolating industry; and Mr. Zachary
Boyd, an ornament of the University of Glasgow,
having worked his will on King David, made
bold rhyming raids on passages of the Bible that
are usually allowed to rest in prose. The high
places of scholarship felt the new infection. Early
in 1648, Joseph Beaumont, afterwards Master of
Peterhouse, and Regius Professor of Divinity at
Cambridge, published his poem called <i>Psyche, or
Love's Mystery</i>, in twenty cantos. "My desire
is," he says in the preface, "that this book may
prompt better wits to believe that a divine theam
is as capable and happy a subject of poetical
ornament, as any pagan or humane device whatsoever."
The poem is about four times as long as
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, and was written in eleven months,
which circumstance, his admiring biographer
allows, "may create some surprise in a reader
unacquainted with the vigorous imagination, and
fertile flow of fancy, which so remarkably distinguished
our author from the common class of
writers." A further explanation by the same
eulogist, who edited Beaumont's <i>Original Poems</i>
in 1749, makes all clear. "Our Author," it
appears, "did not look upon poetry as the serious
business of his life; for whilst he was thus amusing
his leisure hours with the Muses, he wrote a full
<span class="pb" id="pg_177">[177]</span>
and clear commentary upon the Book of Ecclesiastes,
and large critical notes upon the Pentateuch."
After this, the astonished reader will perhaps be
disinclined to verify the statement, reluctantly
made, that in the poems of our author "we sometimes
meet with a vicious copiousness of style, at
others, with an affectation of florid, gay, and
tedious descriptions; nor did he always use the
language of nature."</p>

<p>Next, Cowley "came in robustiously and put
for it with a deal of violence" in his sacred poem
entitled <i>Davideis</i>. In the exordium of the First
Book he proclaims his mission:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Too long the <i>Muses-Lands</i> have <i>Heathen</i> bin</div>
<div class="t0">Their <i>Gods</i> too long were <i>Devils</i>, and <i>Vertues Sin</i>;</div>
<div class="t0">But <i>Thou, Eternal World</i>, hast call'd forth <i>Me</i>,</div>
<div class="t0">Th' <i>Apostle</i>, to convert that <i>World</i> to <i>Thee</i>:</div>
<div class="t0">T' unbind the charms that in slight <i>Fables</i> lie,</div>
<div class="t0">And teach that <i>Truth</i> is <i>truest Poesie</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>But it was not to be. His "polisht <i>Pillars</i> of
strong <i>Verse</i>" were destined never to carry a roof.
The theme, so vigorously introduced, soon languished;
and by the time he had completed a
Fourth Book, it lay, for all his nursing skill,
prematurely dead on his hands. The poem is not
finished, and yet there is nothing to add.</p>

<p>After Cowley in date of composition, but before
him in date of publication, Davenant in his
<i>Gondibert</i> shows traces of the prevalent ambition.
<span class="pb" id="pg_178">[178]</span>
He rejects all supernatural fables, and makes it a
point of sound doctrine to choose only Christians
for his characters. But that poem, too, broke off
in the middle.</p>

<p>In France the question had been as zealously
discussed, and had been illustrated by experiments
no less elaborate. In 1657, a year after the
appearance of Cowley's <i>Davideis</i>, Desmarets de
Saint-Sorlin brought out his sacred poem of <i>Clovis</i>,
with a great flourish of trumpets, and a long prose
demonstration that its theme was the grandest a
French poet could choose. The real supernatural
of the Christian religion, so he argued, is a subject
much nobler for poetry than the pagan mythology,
as the sunlight is brighter than the shadow. The
controversy dragged on till 1673, when Boileau,
in the third book of his <i>Poetic</i>, settled the question
for the nonce, and fixed the opinion of the
succeeding generation of critics. He casts an
equal ridicule upon <i>Clovis</i> and upon the theory
which it was designed to illustrate:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">The arts of fiction give the air of lies</div>
<div class="t0">Even to the most unquestioned verities;</div>
<div class="t0">And what a pious entertainment, too,</div>
<div class="t0">The yells of Satan and his damn&egrave;d crew,</div>
<div class="t0">When, proud to assail your Hero's matchless might,</div>
<div class="t0">With God himself they wage a doubtful fight.</div>
</div>

<p>So the burial of <i>Clovis</i> was hastened by ridicule.
Yet every one of the arguments brought against
<span class="pb" id="pg_179">[179]</span>
that poem by Boileau holds equally good against
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, which Milton, knowing as little of
Boileau as Boileau knew of him, had published
some six years earlier. <i>Paradise Lost</i>, it might
almost be said, is superior to <i>Clovis</i> in nothing,
except the style. By the force of his genius and
the magic of his style, Milton succeeded in an
attempt thought hopeless by the best critical
judges of his century, and won his way through a
ravine that was strewn with the corpses of his epic
predecessors.</p>

<p>His courage and originality are witnessed also
by the metre that he chose for his poem. To us
blank verse seems the natural metre for a long
serious poem. Before Milton's day, except in the
drama, it had only once been so employed--in an
Elizabethan poem of no mark or likelihood, called
<i>A Tale of Two Swannes</i>. While Milton was
writing <i>Paradise Lost</i> the critics of his time were
discussing whether the rhymed couplet or some
form of stanza was fitter for narrative poetry, and
whether the couplet or blank verse better suited
the needs of drama. As no one, before Milton,
had maintained in argument that blank verse was
the best English measure for narrative poetry
dealing with lofty themes, so no critic had ever
been at the pains to refute that opinion. In the
year of the publication of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Dryden
delivered his judgment, that the rhymed couplet
<span class="pb" id="pg_180">[180]</span>
was best suited for tragic passages in the drama,
and that blank verse should be employed chiefly
for the lighter and more colloquial purposes of
comedy. Some echo of the courtly dispute then
in progress between Dryden and his brother-in-law,
Sir Robert Howard, probably reached Milton's
ear through his bookseller, Samuel Simmons; for
it was at the request of his bookseller that he
added the three Miltonic sentences on "The
Verse," by way of preface. With his accustomed
confidence and directness of attack he begs the
question in his first words:--"The measure is
English heroic verse without rime"; and in his
closing words he takes credit to himself for his
"example set, the first in English, of ancient
liberty recovered to heroic poem from the troublesome
and modern bondage of riming."</p>

<p>In these two cardinal points, then--the matter
and the form of his poem--Milton was original.
For the one there was no true precedent in English;
for the other there was no precedent that might
not rather have been called a warning. His matter
was to be arranged and his verse handled by his
own ingenuity and at his own peril. He left a
highroad behind him, along which many a tuneful
pauper has since limped; but before him he found
nothing but the jungle and false fires. In considering
his style, therefore, it is well to treat the
problem as it presented itself to him, and to follow
<span class="pb" id="pg_181">[181]</span>
his achievement as he won step by step out of the
void.</p>

<p>There were two great influences in English
poetry, other than the drama, when Milton began
to write: the influence of Spenser and the influence
of Donne. Only the very slightest traces of either
can be discerned in Milton's early verse. There
are some Spenserian cadences in the poem <i>On the
Death of a Fair Infant</i>, written in his seventeenth
year:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Or wert thou of the golden-wing&egrave;d host</div>
<div class="t0">Who, having clad thyself in human weed,</div>
<div class="t0">To earth from thy prefixed seat didst post,</div>
<div class="t0">And after short abode fly back with speed,</div>
<div class="t0">As if to show what creatures Heaven doth breed;</div>
<div class="t">Thereby to set the hearts of men on fire</div>
<div class="t0">To scorn the sordid world, and unto Heaven aspire?</div>
</div>

<p>The later verses on <i>The Passion</i>, written in the
same metre, are perhaps the last in which Milton
echoes Spenser, however faintly. Meanwhile, in
the hymn <i>On the Morning of Christ's Nativity</i>, he
had struck a note that was his own, and it is not
surprising that he left the poem on the Passion unfinished,
"nothing satisfied with what was begun."</p>

<p>As for the great Dean of St. Paul's, there is no
evidence that Milton was touched by him, or, for
that matter, that he had read any of his poems.
In the verses written <i>At a Vacation Exercise</i>, he
expressly sets aside</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_182">[182]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Those new-fangled toys and trimming slight</div>
<div class="t0">Which takes our late fantastics with delight;</div>
</div>

<p>and he very early came to dislike the fashionable
conceits that ran riot in contemporary English
verse. A certain number of conceits, few and
poor enough, is to be found scattered here and
there in his early poems. Bleak Winter, for
instance, is represented in three cumbrous stanzas,
as the slayer of the Fair Infant:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">For he, being amorous on that lovely dye</div>
<div class="t">That did thy cheek envermeil, thought to kiss,</div>
<div class="t0">But killed, alas! and then bewailed his fatal bliss.</div>
</div>

<p>In the lines on Shakespeare the monument
promised to the dead poet is a marvel of architecture
and sculpture, made up of all his readers,
frozen to statues by the wonder and astonishment
that they feel when they read the plays. But
perhaps the nearest approach to a conceit of the
metaphysical kind is to be found in that passage of
<i>Comus</i>, where the Lady accuses Night of having
stolen her brothers:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">O thievish Night,</div>
<div class="t0">Why shouldst thou, but for some felonious end,</div>
<div class="t0">In thy dark lantern thus close up the stars</div>
<div class="t0">Which Nature hung in heaven, and filled their lamps</div>
<div class="t0">With everlasting oil to give due light</div>
<div class="t0">To the misled and lonely traveller?</div>
</div>

<p>When Milton does fall into a vein of conceit, it
is generally both trivial and obvious, with none of
<span class="pb" id="pg_183">[183]</span>
the saving quality of Donne's remoter extravagances.
In Donne they are hardly extravagances;
the vast overshadowing canopy of his imagination
seems to bring the most wildly dissimilar
things together with ease. To his unfettered
and questioning thought the real seems
unreal, the unreal real; he moves in a world of
shadows, cast by the lurid light of his own
emotions; they take grotesque shapes and beckon
to him, or terrify him. All realities are immaterial
and insubstantial; they shift their expressions,
and lurk in many forms, leaping forth
from the most unlikely disguises, and vanishing as
suddenly as they came.</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish;</div>
<div class="t0">A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,</div>
<div class="t0">A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,</div>
<div class="t0">A forked mountain, or blue promontory</div>
<div class="t0">With trees upon't that nod unto the world,</div>
<div class="t0">And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen these signs;</div>
<div class="t0">They are black Vesper's pageants.</div>
</div>

<p>They are the poems of John Donne. Nothing
could be further from the manner of Milton, or
less likely to overcome his own positive imagination.
Here are two examples of Donne's best
poetic manner:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">But yet thou canst not die, I know;</div>
<div class="t">To leave this world behind, is death;</div>
<div class="t0">But when thou from this world wilt go,</div>
<div class="t">The whole world vapours with thy breath.</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_184">[184]</div>

<p>And again:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Twice or thrice had I loved thee,</div>
<div class="t">Before I knew thy face or name;</div>
<div class="t">So in a voice, so in a shapeless flame</div>
<div class="t0">Angels affect us oft, and worshipp'd be.</div>
</div>

<p>Let it be considered what Milton means by the
terms "World" and "Angel," how clear an
external reality each embodies for him. Any
forced comparison used by him is not an attempt
to express a subtlety, but merely a vicious trick of
the intellect. The virtues of the metaphysical
school were impossible virtues for one whose mind
had no tincture of the metaphysic. Milton, as
has been said already, had no deep sense of
mystery. One passage of <i>Il Penseroso</i>, which
might be quoted against this statement, is susceptible
of an easier explanation:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">And if aught else great bards beside</div>
<div class="t0">In sage and solemn tunes have sung</div>
<div class="t0">Of turneys, and of trophies hung,</div>
<div class="t0">Of forests, and enchantments drear,</div>
<div class="t0">Where more is meant than meets the ear.</div>
</div>

<p>He alludes no doubt to Spenser, and by the last
line intends only allegory--a definite moral signification
affixed to certain characters and stories--not
the mystic correspondences that Donne
loves. The most mysterious lines in <i>Comus</i> are
these:--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_185">[185]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t8">A thousand fantasies</div>
<div class="t0">Begin to throng into my memory,</div>
<div class="t0">Of calling shapes, and beckoning shadows dire,</div>
<div class="t0">And airy tongues that syllable men's names</div>
<div class="t0">On sands and shores and desert wildernesses.</div>
</div>

<p>They are purely Elizabethan and reminiscent.
But if the stranger beauties of the metaphysical
school were beyond his reach, its vices touched
him wonderfully little, so that his conceits are
merely the rare flaws of his early work.</p>

<p>The dramatists were a much more potent
influence than either Spenser or the metaphysical
school. He learned his blank verse from the
dramatists. Perhaps he took the subject of
<i>Comus</i> from the <i>Old Wives' Tale</i> of George Peele;
and when he set himself to write a masque he was
doubtless well acquainted with the works of the
chief master in that kind, Ben Jonson. William
Godwin, in his <i>Lives of Edward and John Phillips</i>,
expresses the opinion that Milton studied the works
of Jonson more assiduously than those of any other
Elizabethan. The specific evidence that he cites--a
few passages of possible reminiscence--is not
convincing. He has no more striking coincidence
to show than the resemblance between a phrase
in <i>Il Penseroso</i>:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Come, but keep thy wonted state</div>
</div>

<p>and two lines of Jonson's <i>Hymn to Cynthia</i>:--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_186">[186]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Seated in thy silver chair</div>
<div class="t0">State in wonted manner keep.</div>
</div>

<p>If the original genius of a poet is to be sworn
away at this rate, there will soon come a time
when no man is secure. Both words are common
in Elizabethan English; if their occurrence in a
single line is to warrant a charge of plagiarism,
the next step will be to make them Jonson's
property, and to forbid the use of either to all
but the tribe of Ben. Milton doubtless studied
Jonson's works; and, if specific resemblances are
both weighed and counted, a good case can be
made out for the influence of Jonson's prose on
the author of the <i>Areopagitica</i>. But the fact is
that criticism finds itself here in a region where
this minute matching of phrase with phrase is
useless or misleading. Milton's early poems grew
on Elizabethan soil, and drank Elizabethan air.
It matters little that there are few verbal coincidences;
the influence is omnipresent, easy to
feel, impossible to describe in detail. From whom
but the Elizabethans could he have learned to
write thus?--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Fly, envious Time, till thou run out thy race:</div>
<div class="t0">Call on the lazy leaden-stepping Hours,</div>
<div class="t0">Whose speed is but the heavy plummet's pace;</div>
<div class="t0">And glut thyself with what thy womb devours.</div>
</div>

<p>The Elizabethan style is not to be mistaken, the
high-figured phrases, loosely welded together,
<span class="pb" id="pg_187">[187]</span>
lulling the imagination into acquiescence by the
flow of the melody. Lines like these might well
occur in <i>Richard II</i>. The same Shakespearian
note is clearly audible in such a passage as this,
where Comus describes the two brothers:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Their port was more than human, as they stood.</div>
<div class="t0">I took it for a faery vision</div>
<div class="t0">Of some gay creatures of the element,</div>
<div class="t0">That in the colours of the rainbow live,</div>
<div class="t0">And play i' the plighted clouds. I was awe-strook,</div>
<div class="t0">And, as I passed, I worshipped. If those you seek,</div>
<div class="t0">It were a journey like the path to Heaven</div>
<div class="t0">To help you find them.</div>
</div>

<p>This has all the technical marks of late Elizabethan
dramatic blank verse: "vision" as a trisyllable;
the redundant syllable in the middle of the line;
the colloquial abbreviation of "in the"; not to
mention the fanciful vein of the whole passage,
which might lead any one unacquainted with
Milton to look for this quotation among the
dramas of the prime. The great hyperbolical
strain of the Elizabethans, which so often broke
into rant, is caught and nobly echoed in praise
of virtue:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t9">If this fail,</div>
<div class="t0">The pillared firmament is rottenness</div>
<div class="t0">And earth's base built on stubble.</div>
</div>

<p>Or, to take a last example of Milton's earlier style,
this description of the Lady's singing is in marked
contrast to the later matured manner:--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_188">[188]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">At last a soft and solemn-breathing sound</div>
<div class="t0">Rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes,</div>
<div class="t0">And stole upon the air, that even Silence</div>
<div class="t0">Was took ere she was ware, and wished she might</div>
<div class="t0">Deny her nature, and be never more</div>
<div class="t0">Still to be so displaced. I was all ear,</div>
<div class="t0">And took in strains that might create a soul</div>
<div class="t0">Under the ribs of Death.</div>
</div>

<p>This has the happy audacity of Shakespeare, and
his delight in playing with logic; it is almost witty.
The Miltonic audacity of the later poems is far
less diffuse and playful. When the nightingale
sings, in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, "Silence was pleased."
When Adam begs the Angel to tell the story of
the Creation, he adds, "Sleep, listening to thee,
will watch." Either of these paradoxes would
have been tormented and elaborated into a puzzle
by a true Elizabethan.</p>

<p>Milton, then, began as a pupil of the dramatists.
But his tendencies and ambitions were not dramatic,
so he escaped the diseases that afflicted the drama
in its decadence. When he began to write blank
verse, the blank verse of the dramatists, his contemporaries,
was fast degenerating into more or
less rhythmical prose. Suckling and Davenant and
their fellows not only used the utmost license of
redundant syllables at the end of the line, but
hustled and slurred the syllables in the middle till
the line was a mere gabble, and interspersed
broken lines so plentifully that it became impossible
<span class="pb" id="pg_189">[189]</span>
even for the most attentive ear to follow
the metre. A brief description of a Puritan
waiting-woman may be taken as an illustration
from Jasper Mayne's comedy of <i>The City Match</i>
(1639). As a sample of blank verse it is perhaps
somewhat smoother and more regular than the
average workmanship of that time:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">She works religious petticoats; for flowers</div>
<div class="t0">She'll make church-histories. Her needle doth</div>
<div class="t0">So sanctify my cushionets; besides</div>
<div class="t0">My smock-sleeves have such holy embroideries,</div>
<div class="t0">And are so learned, that I fear in time</div>
<div class="t0">All my apparel will be quoted by</div>
<div class="t0">Some pure instructor. Yesterday I went</div>
<div class="t0"><i>To see a lady that has a parrot: my woman</i></div>
<div class="t0"><i>While I was in discourse converted the fowl</i>;</div>
<div class="t0">And now it can speak nought but Knox's works;</div>
<div class="t0">So there's a parrot lost.</div>
</div>

<p>Blank verse that has learned to tolerate such lines
as the two here set in italics can only end by
becoming prose. And, indeed, that was the
destined development of the drama, even had
the theatres never been closed under the Commonwealth.
The history of blank verse reflects with
curious exactness the phases of the history of the
drama. When the metre was first set on the
stage, in the Senecan drama, it was stiff and slow-moving;
each line was monotonously accented,
and divided from the next by so heavy a stress
that the absence of rhyme seemed a wilful injury
<span class="pb" id="pg_190">[190]</span>
done to the ear. Such as it was, it suited the
solemn moral platitudes that it was called upon to
utter. Peele, Marlowe, and Shakespeare made
the drama lyrical in theme and treatment; the
measure, adapting itself to the change, became
lyrical in their hands. As the drama grew in
scope and power, addressing itself to a greater
diversity of matter, and coming to closer grips
with the realities of life, the lyrical strain was lost,
and blank verse was stretched and loosened and
made elastic. During the twenty years of Shakespeare's
dramatic activity, from being lyrical it
tended more and more to become conversational
in Comedy, and in Tragedy to depend for its
effects rather on the rhetorical rise and fall of the
period than on the unit of the line. From the
drama of Charles the First's time, when inferior
workmen had carried these licenses to the verge
of confusion, it is a perfectly natural transition to
the heroic couplet for Tragedy and the well-bred
prose of Etherege for Comedy. Blank verse had
lost its character; it had to be made vertebrate
to support the modish extravagances of the heroic
plays; and this was done by the addition of
rhyme. Comedy, on the other hand, was tending
already, long before the civil troubles, to social
satire and the life-like representation of contemporary
character and manners, so that prose
was its only effective instrument.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_191">[191]</div>

<p>At the time when blank verse was yielding to
decay, Milton took it up, and used it neither for
conversational nor for rhetorical purposes. In the
interests of pure poetry and melody he tightened its
joints, stiffened its texture, and one by one gave up
almost all the licenses that the dramatists had used.
From the first he makes a sparing use of the double
ending. The redundant syllable in the middle of
the line, which he sometimes allows himself in
<i>Comus</i>, does not occur in <i>Paradise Lost</i>. In the
later poem he adopts strict practices with regard to
elision, which, with some trifling exceptions, he
permits only in the case of contiguous open vowels,
and of short unstressed vowels separated by a liquid
consonant, in such words, for instance, as "dissolute,"
or "amorous." By a variety of small
observances, which, when fully stated, make up a
formidable code, he mended the shambling gait of
the loose dramatic blank verse, and made of it a
worthy epic metre.</p>

<p>In a long poem variety is indispensable, and he
preserved the utmost freedom in some respects.
He continually varies the stresses in the line, their
number, their weight, and their incidence, letting
them fall, when it pleases his ear, on the odd as
well as on the even syllables of the line. The
pause or c&aelig;sura he permits to fall at any place
in the line, usually towards the middle, but, on
occasion, even after the first or ninth syllables.
<span class="pb" id="pg_192">[192]</span>
His chief study, it will be found, is to vary the
word in relation to the foot, and the sentence in
relation to the line. No other metre allows of
anything like the variety of blank verse in this
regard, and no other metrist makes so splendid a
use of its freedom. He never forgets the pattern;
yet he never stoops to teach it by the repetition of
a monotonous tattoo. Hence there are, perhaps,
fewer one-line quotations to be found in the works
of Milton than in the works of any other master
of blank verse. De Quincey speaks of the "slow
planetary wheelings" of Milton's verse, and the
metaphor is a happy one; the verse revolves on
its axis at every line, but it always has another
motion, and is related to a more distant centre.</p>

<p>It may well be doubted whether Milton could
have given a clear exposition of his own prosody.
In the only place where he attempts it he finds the
elements of musical delight to consist in "apt
numbers, fit quantity of syllables, and the sense
variously drawn out from one verse into another."
By "apt numbers" he probably meant the skilful
handling of stress-variation in relation to the sense.
But the last of the three is the essential of Miltonic
blank verse. There lies the secret for whoso can
divine it.</p>

<p>Every well-marked type of blank verse has a
natural gait or movement of its own, which it
falls into during its ordinary uninspired moods.
<span class="pb" id="pg_193">[193]</span>
Tennyson's blank verse, when it is not carefully
guarded and varied, drops into a kind of fluent sing-song.
Examples may be taken, almost at random,
from the <i>Idylls of the King</i>. Here is one:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">So all the ways were safe from shore to shore,</div>
<div class="t0">But in the heart of Arthur pain was lord.</div>
</div>

<p>The elements of musical delight here are almost
barbarous in their simplicity. There is a surfeit
of assonance--<i>all, shore, shore, lord</i>; <i>heart, Arthur</i>;
<i>ways, safe, pain</i>. The alliteration is without
complexity,--a dreary procession of sibilants.
Worst of all are the monotonous incidence of the
stress, and the unrelieved, undistinguished, crowded
poverty of the Saxon monosyllables.</p>

<p>No two such consecutive lines were ever written
by Milton. His verse, even in its least admirable
passages, does not sing, nor trip with regular alternate
stress; its movement suggests neither dance
nor song, but rather the advancing march of a
body of troops skilfully handled, with incessant
changes in their disposition as they pass over
broken ground. He can furnish them with wings
when it so pleases him. No analysis of his prosody
can explain the wonders of his workmanship. But
it is not idle to ask for a close attention to the
scansion of lines like these, wherein he describes
the upward progress of the Son of God and his
escort after the Creation:--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_194">[194]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">The heavens and all the constellations rung,</div>
<div class="t0">The planets in their station listening stood,</div>
<div class="t0">While the bright pomp ascended jubilant.</div>
</div>

<p>In the last line the first four words marshal the
great procession in solid array; the last two lift
it high into the empyrean. Let any one attempt
to get the same upward effect with a stress, however
light, laid on the last syllable of the line, or
with words of fewer than three syllables apiece,
and he will have to confess that, however abstruse
the rules of its working may be, there is virtue in
metrical cunning. The passage in the Seventh
Book from which these lines are quoted would
justify an entire treatise. The five regular alternate
stresses first occur in a line describing the progress
over the wide plain of Heaven:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t8">He through Heaven,</div>
<div class="t0">That opened wide her blazing portals, led</div>
<div class="t0">To God's eternal house direct the way.</div>
</div>

<p>But, indeed, the examination of the music of
Milton involves so minute a survey of technical
detail as to be tedious to all but a few lovers of
theory. The laws of music in verse are very
subtle, and, it must be added, very imperfectly
ascertained; so that those who dogmatise on them
generally end by slipping into fantasy or pedantry.
How carefully and incessantly Milton adjusted the
sound to the sense is known to every reader of
<span class="pb" id="pg_195">[195]</span>
<i>Paradise Lost</i>. The dullest ear is caught by the
contrast between the opening of the gates of
Heaven--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t8">Heaven opened wide</div>
<div class="t0">Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound</div>
<div class="t0">On golden hinges moving--</div>
</div>

<p>and the opening of those other gates--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t7">On a sudden open fly,</div>
<div class="t0">With impetuous recoil and jarring sound,</div>
<div class="t0">The infernal doors, and on their hinges grate</div>
<div class="t0">Harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook</div>
<div class="t0">Of Erebus.</div>
</div>

<p>But there are many more delicate instances than
these. In the choruses of <i>Samson Agonistes</i>, where
he reaches the top of his skill, Milton varies even
the length of the line. So he has hardly a rule
left, save the iambic pattern, which he treats merely
as a point of departure or reference, a background
or framework to carry the variations imposed upon
it by the luxuriance of a perfectly controlled art.
The great charm of the metre of Wither, which
Charles Lamb admired and imitated, lies in its
facile combination of what, for the sake of brevity,
may be called the iambic and trochaic movements.
In <i>L'Allegro</i> and <i>Il Penseroso</i> Milton had proved
his mastery of both its resources. The gaiety of
these lines--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee</div>
<div class="t0">Jest, and youthful Jollity--</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_196">[196]</div>

<p>passes easily into the solemnity of these--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">But let my due feet never fail</div>
<div class="t0">To walk the studious cloister's pale.</div>
</div>

<p>In <i>Samson Agonistes</i> he sought to extend something
of the same liberty to the movement of
blank verse. He freely intermixes the falling with
the rising stress, shifting the weights from place
to place, and often compensating a light patter of
syllables in the one half of the line by the introduction
of two or three consecutive strong stresses
in the other half. Under this treatment the metre
of <i>Gorboduc</i> breaks into blossom and song:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">O, how comely it is, and how reviving</div>
<div class="t0">To the spirits of just men long oppressed,</div>
<div class="t0">When God into the hands of their deliverer</div>
<div class="t0">Puts invincible might.</div>
</div>

<p>To try to explain this marvel of beauty is to beat
the air.</p>

<p>By his deliberate attention to the elements of
verbal melody Milton gave a new character to
English blank verse. But this is not all. Quite
as important is the alteration that he made in the
character of English poetic diction.</p>

<p>The essence of the lyric is that it is made up
of phrases, not of words. The lines run easily
because they run on tracks chosen for their ease by
the instinct of generations and worn smooth by
use. The lyrical phrase, when the first two or
<span class="pb" id="pg_197">[197]</span>
three words of it have been pronounced, finishes
itself. From Carew's "Ask me no more," with
its long train of imitations, to the latest banality
of the music-halls, the songs that catch the ear
catch it by the same device. The lyric, that is to
say, is almost always dependent for its music on
easy idiomatic turns of speech. The surprising
word occurs rarely; with all the greater effect
inasmuch as it is embedded in phrases that slip
from the tongue without a trace of thought or
effort. These phrases naturally allow of little
diversity of intonation; they have the unity of a
single word, a single accepted emphasis, and a run
of lightly-stressed syllables more or less musical in
sequence.</p>

<p>All this Milton changed. He chooses his every
word. You cannot guess the adjective from the
substantive, nor the end of the phrase from its
beginning. He is much given to inverting the
natural English order of epithet and noun, that he
may gain a greater emphasis for the epithet. His
style is not a simple loose-flowing garment, which
takes its outline from its natural fall over the
figure, but a satin brocade, stiff with gold, exactly
fitted to the body. There is substance for it to
clothe; but, as his imitators quickly discovered, it
can stand alone. He packs his meaning into the
fewest possible words, and studies economy in
every trifle. In his later poetry there are no
<span class="pb" id="pg_198">[198]</span>
gliding connectives; no polysyllabic conjunctive
clauses, which fill the mouth while the brain
prepares itself for the next word of value; no
otiose epithets, and very few that court neglect by
their familiarity. His poetry is like the eloquence
of the Lord Chancellor Bacon, as described by
Ben Jonson:--"No man ever spake more neatly,
more pressly, more weightily, or suffered less
emptiness, less idleness in what he uttered. No
member of his speech but consisted of his own
graces. His hearers could not cough, or look
aside from him, without loss." It is this quality
of Milton's verse that makes the exercise of reading
it aloud a delight and a trial. Every word is of
value. There is no mortar between the stones,
each is held in place by the weight of the others,
and helps to uphold the building. In reading,
every word must be rendered clearly and articulately;
to drop one out, or to slur it over, is to
take a stone from an arch. Indeed, if Lamb and
Hazlitt are right in thinking that Shakespeare's
greatest plays cannot be acted, by the same token,
Milton's greatest poems cannot be read aloud.
For his most sonorous passages the human voice
is felt to be too thin an instrument; the lightest
word in the line demands some faint emphasis,
so that the strongest could not be raised to its
true value unless it were roared through some
melodious megaphone.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_199">[199]</div>

<p>The carefully jewelled mosaic style was
practised very early by Milton. It occurs already
in the hymn on the Nativity:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">See how from far upon the eastern road</div>
<div class="t0">The star-led wizards haste with odours sweet:</div>
<div class="t0">O run, prevent them with thy humble ode</div>
<div class="t0">And lay it lowly at his blessed feet.</div>
</div>

<p>The same deliberateness and gentle pause of words
one after another rounding and falling like clear
drops is found in the song of the Spirit in
<i>Comus</i>:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Sabrina fair,</div>
<div class="t">Listen where thou art sitting</div>
<div class="t0">Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,</div>
<div class="t">In twisted braids of lilies knitting</div>
<div class="t0">The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair.</div>
</div>

<p>This is the effect which Sir Henry Wotton,
Milton's earliest critic, speaks of, in a letter to
Milton, as "a certain Doric delicacy in your songs
and odes, whereunto I must plainly confess to have
seen yet nothing parallel in our language."</p>

<p>There are poems, and good poems among the
number, written on a more diffuse principle. If
you miss one line you find the idea repeated or
persisting in the next. It is quite possible to
derive pleasure from the <i>Faerie Queene</i> by attending
to the leading words, and, for the rest, floating
onward on the melody. You can catch the drift
with ease. The stream circles in so many eddies
<span class="pb" id="pg_200">[200]</span>
that to follow it laboriously throughout its course
is felt to be hardly necessary: miss it once and
you can often join it again at very near the same
point. "But a reader of Milton," as an early
critic of Milton remarks, "must be always upon
duty; he is surrounded with sense; it rises in
every line, every word is to the purpose. There
are no lazy intervals: all has been considered, and
demands and merits observation. Even in the
best writers you sometimes find words and sentences
which hang on so loosely, you may blow them off.
Milton's are all substance and weight: fewer would
not have served his turn, and more would have
been superfluous. His silence has the same effect,
not only that he leaves work for the imagination,
when he has entertained it and furnished it with
noble materials; but he expresses himself so concisely,
employs words so sparingly, that whoever
will possess his ideas must dig for them, and oftentimes
pretty far below the surface."</p>

<p>An illustration and contrast may serve to point
the moral. Here is an example of Spenser's
diffuser style, taken from the second book of the
<i>Faerie Queene</i>. Guyon, escaped from the cave of
Mammon, is guarded, during his swoon, by an
angel:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Beside his head there satt a faire young man,</div>
</div>

<p>(This announces the theme, as in music.)</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_201">[201]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Of wondrous beauty and of freshest yeares,</div>
</div>

<p>(The fair young man was fair and young.)</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Whose tender bud to blossom new began,</div>
</div>

<p>(The fair young man was young.)</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">And florish faire above his equal peers.</div>
</div>

<p>(The fair young man was fair, fairer even than his
equals, who were also his peers.)</p>

<p>In the remaining lines of the stanza the comparison
of his hair to the rays of the sun is played
with in the same way:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">His snowy front curled with golden heares,</div>
<div class="t0">Like Ph&oelig;bus' face adorned with sunny rayes,</div>
<div class="t0">Divinely shone; and two sharp winged sheares,</div>
<div class="t0">Decked with diverse plumes, like painted Jayes,</div>
<div class="t0">Were fixed at his back to cut his ayery wayes.</div>
</div>

<p>The whole stanza is beautiful, and musical with the
music of redundance. Nothing could be less like
Milton's mature style. His verse, "with frock of
mail, Adamantean proof," advances proudly and
irresistibly, gaining ground at every step. He
brings a situation before us in two lines, every
word contributing its share:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat,</div>
<div class="t0">Chief of the angelic guards, awaiting night.</div>
</div>

<p>With as decisive a touch he sketches the story of Jacob--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_202">[202]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t9">In the field of Luz,</div>
<div class="t0">Dreaming by night under the open sky,</div>
<div class="t0">And waking cried, <i>This is the gate of Heaven</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>Or the descent of Raphael:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t9">Like Maia's son he stood,</div>
<div class="t0">And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled</div>
<div class="t0">The circuit wide.</div>
</div>

<p>The packed line introduced by Milton is of a
greater density and conciseness than anything to
be found in English literature before it. It is our
nearest native counterpart to the force and reserve
of the high Virgilian diction. In his <i>Discourse of
the Original and Progress of Satire</i>, Dryden has
called attention to the close-wrought quality of
Virgil's work. "Virgil," he says, "could have
written sharper satires than either Horace or
Juvenal, if he would have employed his talent that
way. I will produce a verse and a half of his, in
one of his Eclogues, to justify my opinion; and
with commas after every word, to show that he
has given almost as many lashes as he has written
syllables: it is against a bad poet, whose ill verses
he describes:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t6"><i>non tu, in triviis, indocte, solebas</i></div>
<div class="t0"><i>Stridenti, miserum, stipula, disperdere, carmen?</i>"</div>
<div class="t0">[Wouldst thou not, blockhead, in the public ways,</div>
<div class="t0">Squander, on scrannel pipe, thy sorry lays?]</div>
</div>

<p>Dryden appreciated the terrible force of this
<span class="pb" id="pg_203">[203]</span>
kind of writing for the purposes of satire. At its
best, his own satire attains to something like it, as,
for instance, in his description of Shaftesbury's
early life:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Next this (how wildly will ambition steer),</div>
<div class="t0">A vermin wriggling in the usurper's ear,</div>
<div class="t0">Bartering his venal wit for sums of gold,</div>
<div class="t0">He cast himself into the saint-like mould;</div>
<div class="t0">Groaned, sighed, and prayed, while godliness was gain,</div>
<div class="t0">The loudest bagpipe of the squeaking train.</div>
</div>

<p>Except the first line, which is wholly idle, there is
nothing that could be spared here. Pope, also,
knew the value of condensation; but he works in
antithetic phrases, so that his single words are less
telling; and where Dryden's lines are swords
edged with contempt, Pope's are stings, pointed
with spite. Thus, of Lord Hervey:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Amphibious thing! that acting either part,</div>
<div class="t0">The trifling head, or the corrupted heart,</div>
<div class="t0">Fop at the toilet, flatterer at the board,</div>
<div class="t0">Now trips a lady, and now struts a lord.</div>
<div class="t0">Eve's tempter thus the Rabbins have exprest,</div>
<div class="t0">A cherub's face, a reptile all the rest;</div>
<div class="t0">Beauty that shocks you, parts that none will trust,</div>
<div class="t0">Wit that can creep, and pride that licks the dust.</div>
</div>

<p>The necessities of rhyme sometimes hamper both
Dryden and Pope; and the nearest parallel to the
manner of Virgil is to be sought in Milton. The
famous line describing Samson--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_204">[204]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Eyeless, in Gaza, at the mill, with slaves--</div>
</div>

<p>is a good example; the sense of humiliation and
abasement is intensified at every step. Or, to
take a passage in a very different key of feeling,
the same quality is seen in the description of the
obedience of Eve:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t6">Required with gentle sway</div>
<div class="t0">And by her yielded, by him best received,</div>
<div class="t0">Yielded with coy submission, modest pride,</div>
<div class="t0">And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay.</div>
</div>

<p>The slight stress and pause needed after each
word, to render the full meaning, produce, when
the words are short as well as emphatic, a line of
terrific weight and impact. What more heartbreaking
effect of weariness and eternity of effort
could be produced in a single line than this, descriptive
of the dolorous march of the fallen angels?--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">O'er many a frozen, many a fiery Alp,</div>
<div class="t0">Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death.</div>
</div>

<p>It would be difficult to match this line. In <i>The
Tears of Peace</i>, Chapman has a line (he repeats it
in the <i>Tragedy of Biron</i>) which owes some of its
strength to the same cause. He describes the body
as--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">This glass of air, broken with less than breath,</div>
<div class="t0">This slave, bound face to face to death till death.</div>
</div>

<p>The eight stresses give the line a passionate energy.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_205">[205]</div>

<p>All superfluous graces are usually discarded by
Milton. He steers right onward, and gives the
reader no rest. A French critic of that age, who
has already been mentioned as the author of <i>Clovis</i>,
praises Malherbe and Voiture and the worthies of
their time, at the expense of the ancients. He
calls Homer, especially, "a tattler, who is incessantly
repeating the same things in the same
idle ridiculous epithets,--<i>the swift-footed Achilles,
the ox-eyed Juno, far-darting Apollo</i>." Milton felt
none of this contempt for Homer, but he discarded
the practice. His epithets are chosen to
perform one exploit, and are dismissed when it is
accomplished. As with single epithets, so with
lines and phrases; he does not employ conventional
repetitions either for their lyrical value or
for wafting the story on to the next point of
interest. He seeks no effects such as Marlowe
obtained by the lyrical repetition of the line:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">To entertain divine Zenocrate.</div>
</div>

<p>He arrests the attention at every word; and
when the thing is once said, he has done with it.</p>

<p>In his <i>Discourse of Satire</i> Dryden raises an
interesting point. He makes mention of "the
beautiful turns of words and thoughts, which are
as requisite in this, as in heroick poetry itself, of
which the satire is undoubtedly a species." His
attention, he says, was first called to these by Sir
<span class="pb" id="pg_206">[206]</span>
George Mackenzie, who repeated many of them
from Waller and Denham. Thereupon he
searched other authors, Cowley, Davenant, and
Milton, to find further examples of them; but in
vain. At last he had recourse to Spenser, "and
there I met with that which I had been looking
for so long in vain. Spenser had studied Virgil
to as much advantage as Milton had done Homer;
and amongst the rest of his excellencies had copied
that."</p>

<p>By the "turns of words and thoughts" Dryden
here means the repetition of a word or phrase in
slightly altered guise as the thought is turned over
in the mind and presented in a new aspect. There
is an almost epigrammatic neatness about some of
the examples that he cites from Ovid and Catullus.
It is not surprising that he failed to find these
elegant turns in Milton, for they are few.
Addison and Steele, writing in the <i>Tatler</i>, reproach
him with having overlooked the speech of Eve in
the Fourth Book of <i>Paradise Lost</i>:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet,</div>
<div class="t0">With charm of earliest birds; pleasant the Sun,</div>
<div class="t0">When first on this delightful land he spreads</div>
<div class="t0">His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,</div>
<div class="t0">Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile Earth</div>
<div class="t0">After soft showers; and sweet the coming-on</div>
<div class="t0">Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night,</div>
<div class="t0">With this her solemn bird, and this fair Moon,</div>
<div class="t0">And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train:</div>
<span class="pb" id="pg_207">[207]</span>
<div class="t0">But neither breath of Morn, when she ascends</div>
<div class="t0">With charm of earliest birds; nor rising Sun</div>
<div class="t0">On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower,</div>
<div class="t0">Glistering with dew; nor fragrance after showers</div>
<div class="t0">Nor grateful Evening mild; nor silent Night,</div>
<div class="t0">With this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon,</div>
<div class="t0">Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet.</div>
</div>

<p>Dryden remarks that the elegance he speaks of
is common in Italian sonnets, which are usually
written on the turn of the first thought; and
certainly this speech of Eve might be truly compared,
in all but the metrical structure, to an
interspersed sonnet. There is another elaborate
piece of repetition at the close of the Tenth Book,
where the humble prostration of Adam and Eve
is described in exactly the form of speech used by
Adam to propose it. But the repetition in this
case is too exact to suit Dryden's meaning; by a
close verbal coincidence the ritual of penitence is
emphasised in detail, and the book brought to a
restful pause. Scattered here and there throughout
Milton's longer poems Dryden might, nevertheless,
have found the thing he sought. One instance
that he gives is taken from the fourth Georgic of
Virgil, where Orpheus, leading Eurydice up from
Hell, suddenly turns to look on her:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0"><i>Cum subita incautum dementia cepit amantem;</i></div>
<div class="t0"><i>Ignoscenda quidem, scirent si ignoscere Manes.</i></div>
</div>

<p>This turn--"deserving grace, if grace were known
<span class="pb" id="pg_208">[208]</span>
in Hell"--may easily be matched in Milton. In
the Second Book of <i>Paradise Lost</i> is described
how the damned</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t7">feel by turns the bitter change</div>
<div class="t0">Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce.</div>
</div>

<p>In the Fifth Book, when Raphael arrives at the
gate of Paradise, the angels</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">to his state</div>
<div class="t0">And to his message high in honour rise,</div>
<div class="t0">For on some message high they guessed him bound.</div>
</div>

<p>In <i>Samson Agonistes</i> it is noted that nations grown
corrupt</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t5">love bondage more than liberty,</div>
<div class="t0">Bondage with ease than strenuous liberty.</div>
</div>

<p>Yet in the main Dryden is right, for even
instances like these are not many, and the tricky
neatness of Ovid is nowhere to be found in the
English epic poet.</p>

<p>Milton seldom allows his verse to play in
eddies; he taxes every line to its fullest capacity,
and wrings the last drop of value from each word.
A signal characteristic of his diction has its origin
in this hard dealing. He is often not satisfied
with one meaning from a word, but will make it
do double duty. Here the Latin element in our
language gave him his opportunity. Words
borrowed from the Latin always change their
usage and value in English air. To the ordinary
<span class="pb" id="pg_209">[209]</span>
intelligence they convey one meaning; to a
scholar's memory they suggest also another. It
became the habit of Milton to make use of both
values, to assess his words in both capacities. Any
page of his work furnishes examples of his delicate
care for the original meaning of Latin words, such
as <i>intend</i>--"intend at home ... what best may
ease the present misery"; <i>arrive</i>--"ere he arrive
the happy Isle"; <i>obnoxious</i>--"obnoxious more to
all the miseries of life"; <i>punctual</i>--"this opacous
Earth, this punctual spot"; <i>sagacious</i>--"sagacious
of his quarry from so far"; <i>explode</i>--"the
applause they meant turned to exploding hiss";
<i>retort</i>--"with retorted scorn his back he turned";
<i>infest</i>--"find some occasion to infest our foes."
The Speaker of the House of Commons had to
determine, some years ago, whether it is in order
to allude to the Members as "infesting" the
House. Had Milton been called upon for such a
decision he would doubtless have ruled that the
word is applicable only to Members whose
deliberate intention is to maim or destroy the
constitution of Parliament.</p>

<p>But he was not content to revive the exact
classical meaning in place of the vague or weak
English acceptation; he often kept both senses,
and loaded the word with two meanings at once.
When Samson speaks of Dalila as</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">That specious monster, my accomplished snare--</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_210">[210]</div>

<p>something of this double sense resides in both
epithets. In two words we are told that Dalila
was both beautiful and deceitful, that she was
skilled in the blandishments of art, and successful
in the work of her husband's undoing. With a
like double reference Samson calls the secret of his
strength "my capital secret." Where light, again,
is called the "prime work of God," or where we
are told that Hell saw "Heaven ruining from
Heaven," the original and derivative senses of the
words "prime" and "ruin" are united in the
conception. These words, and many others
similarly employed, are of Latin origin; but
Milton carried his practice over into the Saxon
part of our vocabulary. The word "uncouth"
is used in a double-barrelled sense in the Second
Book of <i>Paradise Lost</i>--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t2">Who shall tempt with wandering feet</div>
<div class="t0">The dark, unbottomed, infinite Abyss,</div>
<div class="t0">And through the palpable obscure find out</div>
<div class="t0">His uncouth way?</div>
</div>

<p>And when Satan's eyes are called "baleful," the
word, besides indicating the "huge affliction and
dismay" that he feels, gives a hint of the woes
that are in store for the victims on whom those
eyes have not yet lit.</p>

<p>It was this habit of "verbal curiosity" and
condensation which seduced Milton into punning.
Some of his puns are very bad. There is a
<span class="pb" id="pg_211">[211]</span>
modern idea that a pun is a thing to laugh at.
Milton's puns, like Shakespeare's, give no smallest
countenance to this theory. Sometimes he plays
with what is merely a chance identity of sound, as
where Satan, entering Paradise--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">At one slight bound high overleapt all bound.</div>
</div>

<p>But in most of these cases it seems likely that he
believed in an etymological relation between the
two words, and so fancied that he was drawing
attention to an original unity of meaning. Some
such hypothesis is needful to mitigate the atrocity
of his worst pun, in <i>Paradise Regained</i>, where he
describes</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t6">The ravens with their horny beaks</div>
<div class="t0">Food to Elijah bringing even and morn--</div>
<div class="t0">Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought.</div>
</div>

<p>Milton was no philologist, and we may be permitted
in charity to suppose that he derived
"raven" and "ravenous" from the same root.</p>

<p>Some of his puns are to be justified for
another reason--that they are made the weapons
of mockery. So when Satan rails against Abdiel
he says--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t10">Thou shalt behold</div>
<div class="t0">Whether by supplication we intend</div>
<div class="t0">Address, and to begirt the Almighty Throne</div>
<div class="t0">Beseeching or besieging.</div>
</div>

<p>The long punning-bout between Satan and Belial
<span class="pb" id="pg_212">[212]</span>
in the Sixth Book exemplifies the more usual form
of the Miltonic pun. When he introduces the
newly-invented artillery, Satan makes a speech,
"scoffing in ambiguous words"--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t9">Ye, who appointed stand,</div>
<div class="t0">Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch</div>
<div class="t0">What we propound, and loud that all may hear.</div>
</div>

<p>And again, when it has taken effect, scattering the
heavenly host in unseemly disorder, he says--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">If our proposals once again were heard,</div>
<div class="t0">We should compel them to a quick result.</div>
</div>

<p>Belial, "in like gamesome mood," replies to the
jests of his leader, until, by the providence of
Heaven, his wit and his artillery are buried under
a weight heavier than themselves. On this whole
scene Landor remarks that "the first overt crime
of the refractory angels was punning"; and adds,
with true Miltonic conciseness, "they fell rapidly
after that."</p>

<p>Some minor flaws, which may be found in
Milton by those who give a close examination to
his works, are to be attributed to the same cause--his
love of condensed statement. Mixture of
metaphors in poetry is often caused merely by the
speed of thought, which presents a subject in a
new aspect without care taken to adjust or
alter the figure. In these cases the obscurity or
violence of expression arises not from defect, but
<span class="pb" id="pg_213">[213]</span>
from excess of thought. Some few instances occur
in Milton, who, in <i>Lycidas</i>, writes thus--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">But now my oat proceeds,</div>
<div class="t0">And listens to the Herald of the Sea.</div>
</div>

<p>The syntax of the thought is sufficiently lucid and
orderly, but it is compressed into too few words.
In the Fifth Book of <i>Paradise Lost</i> is described
how--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t3">The Eternal Eye, whose sight discerns</div>
<div class="t0">Abtrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount,</div>
<div class="t0">And from within the golden lamps that burn</div>
<div class="t0">Nightly before him, saw without their light</div>
<div class="t0">Rebellion rising--saw in whom, how spread</div>
<div class="t0">Among the Sons of Morn, what multitudes</div>
<div class="t0">Were banded to oppose his high decree;</div>
<div class="t0">And, smiling, to his only Son thus said.</div>
</div>

<p>Here, it is true, "the Eternal Eye" smiles and
speaks to his only Son. But Milton has really
discarded the figure after the words "his high
decree," which bring in a new order of thoughts.
He trusts the reader to follow his thought without
grammatical readjustment--to drop the symbol
and remember only the thing symbolised. His
trust was warranted, until Landor detected the
solecism. The clearest case of mixed metaphor ever
charged against Milton occurs in the Eleventh
Book, where the lazar-house is described--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Sight so deform what heart of rock could long</div>
<div class="t0">Dry-eyed behold?</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_214">[214]</div>

<p>Rogers pointed this out to Coleridge, who told
Wordsworth that he could not sleep all the next
night for thinking of it. What months of
insomnia must he not have suffered from the
perusal of Shakespeare's works!</p>

<p>The close-wrought style of Milton makes the
reading of <i>Paradise Lost</i> a hard task in this sense,
that it is a severe intellectual exercise, without
relaxation. The attention that it demands, word
by word, and line by line, could not profitably
be given to most books; so that many readers,
trained by a long course of novel-reading to
nibble and browse through the pastures of
literature, find that Milton yields little or no
delight under their treatment, and abandon him
in despair.</p>

<p>And yet, with however great reluctance, it
must be admitted that the close study and admiring
imitation of Milton bring in their train
some lesser evils. Meaning may be arranged too
compactly in a sentence; for perfect and ready
assimilation some bulk and distention are necessary
in language as in diet. Now the study of
Milton, if it teaches anything, teaches to discard
and abhor all superfluity. He who models himself
upon this master will never "go a-begging
for some meaning, and labour to be delivered of
the great burden of nothing." But he may easily
fall into the opposite error of putting "riddles of
<span class="pb" id="pg_215">[215]</span>
wit, by being too scarce of words." He will be
so intent upon the final and perfect expression of
his thought, that his life may pass before he finds
it, and even if, in the end, he should say a thing
well, he is little likely to say it in due season.
"Brevity is attained in matter," says a master of
English prose, "by avoiding idle compliments,
prefaces, protestations, parentheses, superfluous
circuit of figures and digressions: in the composition,
by omitting conjunctions--<i>not only ...
but also, both the one and the other, whereby it cometh
to pass</i>, and such like idle particles." Either
sort of brevity may be learned from Milton. But
any one who has been compelled to make efforts
of unprompted eloquence, and to choose his expressions
while he is on his feet, knows well
how necessary is the function performed by these
same prefaces, protestations, parentheses, and idle
particles. Suavely uttered, they keep expectation
alive in the audience, and give the orator time
to think. Whether in speaking or in writing, no
fluent and popular style can well be without them.
<i>I should be inclined to say--If I may be permitted
to use the expression--Speaking for myself and for
those who agree with me--It is no great rashness to
assert</i>-- a hundred phrases like these are an indispensable
part of an easy writer's, as of an easy
speaker's, equipment. To forego all these swollen
and diluted forms of speech is to run the risk of
<span class="pb" id="pg_216">[216]</span>
the opposite danger, congestion of the thought and
paralysis of the pen--the scholar's melancholy.
To give long days and nights to the study of
Milton is to cultivate the critical faculty to so high
a pitch that it may possibly become tyrannical,
and learn to distaste all free writing. Accustomed
to control and punish wanton activity, it will
anticipate its judicial duties, and, not content
with inflicting death, will devote its malign energy
to preventing birth.</p>

<p>It is good, therefore, to remember that Milton
himself took a holiday sometimes, and gave a
loose to his pen and to his thought. Some parts
of his prose writings run in a full torrent of unchastened
eloquence. An open playground for
exuberant activity is of the first importance for a
writer. Johnson found such a playground in
talk. There he could take the curb off his
prejudices, give the rein to his whimsical fancy,
and better his expression as he talked. But where
men must talk, as well as write, upon oath,
paralysis is not easily avoided. In the little
mincing societies addicted to intellectual and
moral culture the creative zest is lost. The
painful inhibition of a continual rigorous choice,
if it is never relaxed, cripples the activity of the
mind. Those who can talk the best and most
compact sense have often found irresponsible
paradox and nonsense a useful and pleasant
<span class="pb" id="pg_217">[217]</span>
recreation ground. It was Milton's misfortune,
not the least of those put upon him by the bad
age in which he lived, that what Shakespeare
found in the tavern he had to seek in the Church.
Denied the wild wit-combats of the Mermaid, he
disported himself in a pamphlet-war on bishops
and divorce. But he found health and exercise
for his faculties there; and the moral (for all
things have a moral) is this: that when, in a
mood of self-indulgence, we can write habitually
with the gust, the licentious force, the flow, and
the careless wealthy insolence of the <i>Animadversions
upon the Remonstrant's Defence against Smectymnuus</i>,
we need not then repine or be ill-content
if we find that we can rise only occasionally to the
chastity, the severity, and the girded majesty of
<i>Paradise Lost</i>.</p>

<h2><a id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br />THE STYLE OF MILTON; AND ITS INFLUENCE ON ENGLISH POETRY</a></h2>

<p>When Milton was born, Shakespeare, Jonson,
Beaumont, Dekker, Chapman, Daniel, Drayton,
and half a hundred other Elizabethan notables
were yet alive. When he died, Addison, Swift,
Steele, and Arbuthnot were already born. Thus
his life bridges the gulf between the age of Elizabeth
and the age of Anne; and this further
examination of his style has for object to inquire
what part he may claim in the change of temper,
method, subject, and form which came over
English poetry during that period.</p>

<p>The answer usually given to this question is
that he had no part at all. He lived and died
alone. He imitated no one, and founded no
school. There was none of his more distinguished
contemporaries with whom he was on terms of
intimacy; none whose ideals in poetry remotely
resembled his. So that although he is to be
<span class="pb" id="pg_219">[219]</span>
ranged among the greatest of English poets, a
place in the legitimate hereditary succession would,
on these considerations, be denied to him. When
Dryden succeeded to the dictatorship of Jonson,
the continuity of literary history was resumed.
The great processes of change which affected
English letters during the seventeenth century are
in no way associated with the name of Milton.
Waller and Denham, Davenant and Dryden, "reformed"
English verse; Hobbes, Cowley, Tillotson,
Dryden and Sprat remodelled English prose.
And in the meantime, if this account is to be
accepted, while English verse and English prose
were in the melting-pot, this splendid efflorescence
was an accident, a by-product, without meaning
or causal virtue in the chemical process that was
going forward.</p>

<p>Others will have it that Milton was a belated
Elizabethan. But the difficulty of that theory is
that he reversed rather than continued many of
the practices of the Elizabethans, and introduced
reforms of his own, no less striking than the
reforms effected by Dryden. Shirley is a good
example of a genuine late Elizabethan. But in
Shirley's works there is nothing that is not an
echo. In Milton's, on the other hand, after the
volume of 1645, there is nothing that echoes any
earlier English poet even faintly. He renayed
his ancestry; and, if he left no descendants,
<span class="pb" id="pg_220">[220]</span>
he must needs be regarded as "a vast species
alone."</p>

<p>The Elizabethans, including even the author
of <i>Sejanus</i> and the translator of Homer, were
Romantics. The terms Romantic and Classic
are perhaps something overworn; and, although
they are useful to supply a reason, it may well be
doubted whether they ever helped any one to an
understanding. Yet here, if anywhere, they are in
place; for Milton is, by common consent, not
only a Classic poet, but the greatest exemplar of
the style in the long bead-roll of English poets.
The "Augustans" prided themselves on their
resemblance to the poets of the great age of Rome.
Was there nothing in common between them and
Milton, and did they really borrow nothing and
learn nothing from him?</p>

<p>This much is agreed, that of all English styles
Milton's is best entitled to the name of Classic.
In his poems may be found every device that
belongs to the Classic manner, as in Shakespeare's
plays may be found every device that belongs
distinctively to the Romantic. Perhaps the two
manners are best compared by the juxtaposition of
descriptive passages. In description it is impossible
for literature to be exhaustive; a choice must be
made, an aspect emphasised, and by far the greater
part left to the imagination of the reader. A man,
for instance, has stature, feature, bones, muscles,
<span class="pb" id="pg_221">[221]</span>
nerves, entrails; his eyes, hair, and skin are of
certain colours; he stands in a particular attitude
at a particular spot on the surface of the earth;
he is agitated by certain passions and ideas; every
movement that he makes is related to his constitution
and his past history; he has affinity with
other men by the ties of the family, the society,
the State; he thinks and acts more in a minute
than a hundred writers can describe and explain in
a year; he is a laughing, weeping, money-making,
clothes-wearing, lying, reasoning, worshipping,
amorous, credulous, sceptical, imitative, combative,
gregarious, prehensile, two-legged animal. He
does not cease to be all this and more, merely
because he happens to be at one of his thousand
tricks, and you catch him in the act. How do
you propose to describe him?</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, there are two methods available.
You may begin with the more general and
comprehensive of the relations that fall in with
your purpose, securing breadth of view and truth
in the larger values, leaving the imagination to
supply the more particular and personal details on
the barest of hints from you: or you may fix your
gaze exclusively on some vivid cluster of details,
indicating their remoter relations and their place
in a wider perspective by a few vague suggestions.</p>

<p>The first of these ways is Milton's. He maps
out his descriptions in bold outline, attending
<span class="pb" id="pg_222">[222]</span>
always to the unity of the picture and the truth
of the larger relations. He is chary of detail, and
what he adds is added for its own immediate importance
rather than for its remoter power of
suggestion. Adam and Eve when they are first
introduced, are thus described:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall,</div>
<div class="t0">Godlike erect, with native honour clad</div>
<div class="t0">In naked majesty, seemed lords of all,</div>
<div class="t0">And worthy seemed; for in their looks divine</div>
<div class="t0">The image of their glorious Maker shone,</div>
<div class="t0">Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure,--</div>
<div class="t0">Severe, but in true filial freedom placed,</div>
<div class="t0">Whence true authority in men.</div>
</div>

<p>As pictorial description this is all but completely
empty. It tells you only that they stood upright,
that they were like their Maker, and that they
were possessed of the virtues that their appearance
would lead you to expect. Their physical delineation
is to be accommodated by the imagination of
the reader to this long catalogue of moral qualities,--nobility,
honour, majesty, lordliness, worth,
divinity, glory, brightness, truth, wisdom, sanctitude,
severity, and purity. In the following lines
the poet proceeds to distinguish the one figure
from the other, adding a few details with regard
to each. The epithets he chooses are still vague.
Adam's forehead is "fair" and "large," his eye
is "sublime," his locks are "hyacinthine," and (a
<span class="pb" id="pg_223">[223]</span>
detail that has escaped the notice of many illustrators
of <i>Paradise Lost</i>) they fall in clusters as low
as his shoulders. From beginning to end of the
description the aim of the poet is to preserve the
right key of large emotion, and the words that he
chooses are chosen chiefly for their emotional
value. The emotions are given; the portraiture
is left to be filled in by the imagination.</p>

<p>Shakespeare commonly works in the reverse
way. He does not, like Crabbe, describe "as if
for the police"; he chooses his detail with consummate
skill, but he makes use of it to suggest
the emotions. It is impossible to set his description
of persons over against Milton's; for the
drama does not describe persons, it presents them
in action; and a description, where it occurs, is
often designed merely to throw light on the character
and feelings of the speaker. "Her voice
was ever soft, gentle, and low" is a description
rather of Lear, as he hangs over the dead body of
Cordelia, refusing to believe that she is dead, than
of Cordelia herself. "An excellent thing in
woman" is not a doctrine, but a last heartbreaking
movement of defiance, as if to refute any stander-by
who dares to think that there is something
amiss, that a voice should not be so low as to be
inaudible.</p>

<p>The contrast of the methods may, therefore, be
better noted in the description of scenes. There
<span class="pb" id="pg_224">[224]</span>
is no very close parallel obtainable; but the two
passages compared by Lessing are not wholly dissimilar
in theme, and serve well enough to illustrate
the difference of the styles. The first, taken from
the Seventh Book of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, tells how the
King of Glory, from the verge of his heavenly
domain, beholds the gulf of Chaos:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">On Heavenly ground they stood, and from the shore</div>
<div class="t0">They viewed the vast immeasurable Abyss,</div>
<div class="t0">Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild,</div>
<div class="t0">Up from the bottom turned by furious winds</div>
<div class="t0">And surging waves, as mountains to assault</div>
<div class="t0">Heaven's highth, and with the centre mix the pole.</div>
</div>

<p>The other is the imaginary view from Dover Cliff,
described by Edgar in <i>King Lear</i>:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t10">How fearful</div>
<div class="t0">And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!</div>
<div class="t0">The crows and choughs that wing the midway air</div>
<div class="t0">Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down</div>
<div class="t0">Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!</div>
<div class="t0">Methinks he seems no bigger than his head;</div>
<div class="t0">The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,</div>
<div class="t0">Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,</div>
<div class="t0">Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy</div>
<div class="t0">Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge</div>
<div class="t0">That on th' unnumbered idle pebbles chafes,</div>
<div class="t0">Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;</div>
<div class="t0">Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight</div>
<div class="t0">Topple down headlong.</div>
</div>

<p>Johnson objected to this description: "No,
sir; it should be all precipice,--all vacuum.
<span class="pb" id="pg_225">[225]</span>
The crows impede your fall. The diminished
appearance of the boats, and other circumstances,
are all very good description, but do not impress
the mind at once with the horrible idea of immense
height. The impression is divided; you pass on,
by computation, from one stage of the tremendous
space to another."</p>

<p>This criticism is, in effect, a plea for Milton's
method, although by a freak of fate it was uttered
in vindication of Congreve. Some years earlier,
in his edition of Shakespeare, Johnson had remarked
on the same passage, and had indicated
the poetic method that he approved: "He that
looks from a precipice finds himself assailed by
one great and dreadful image of irresistible destruction."</p>

<p>Johnson's critical opinions on poetry are deserving
of the most careful consideration, and, where
they fail to convince, of an undiminished respect.
But not Johnson himself can raise a doubt as to
which of the two passages quoted above is the
greater masterpiece of description proper. Shakespeare
sets a scene before your eyes, and by his
happy choice of vivid impression makes you giddy.
The crows help, rather than impede your fall; for
to look into illimitable vacuum is to look at
nothing, and therefore to be unmoved. But the
classic manner is so careful for unity of emotional
impression that it rejects these humble means for
<span class="pb" id="pg_226">[226]</span>
attaining even to so great an end. It refuses to
work by mice and beetles, lest the sudden intrusion
of trivial associations should mar the main impression.
No sharp discords are allowed, even though
they should be resolved the moment after. Every
word and every image must help forward the main
purpose. Thus, while the besetting sin of the
Romantics is the employment of excessive, or irrelevant,
or trivial or grotesque detail, the besetting
sin of the Classics is so complete an omission of
realistic detail that the description becomes inflated,
windy and empty, and the strongest words in the
language lose their vital force because they are set
fluttering hither and thither in multitudes, with no
substantial hold upon reality. There is nothing
that dies sooner than an emotion when it is cut off
from the stock on which it grows. The descriptive
epithet or adjective, if only it be sparingly
and skilfully employed, so that the substantive
carry it easily, is the strongest word in a sentence.
But when once it loses its hold upon concrete
reality it becomes the weakest, and not all the
protests of debility, superlative degrees, and rhetorical
insistence, can save it from neglect.</p>

<p>It is apparent, therefore, how necessary to
Milton were the concrete epic realities with which
his poem deals,--the topographical scheme of
things, and the definite embodiment of all his
spiritual essences. Keats' <i>Hyperion</i> fails largely
<span class="pb" id="pg_227">[227]</span>
for want of an exact physical system such as
Milton devises. Keats works almost wholly with
vague Romantic suggestion, and there is nothing
for the poem to hang on by. Something is happening;
but it is difficult to say what, for we see
only dream-imagery, and hear only muffled echoes.
Had Milton made unsparing use of abstraction
and suggestion, his poem would have fallen into
windy chaos. The "philosophical poems" of his
age did so fall. Henry More's <i>Platonick Song
of the Soul</i> (1642), wherein are treated the Life
of the Soul, her Immortality, the Sleep of the
Soul, the Unity of Souls, and Memory after
Death, is a dust-storm of verbiage. Such words
as "calefaction," "exility," "self-reduplication,"
"tricentreity," "individuation," "circumvolution,"
"presentifick circularity," struggle and
sprawl within the narrow room of the Spenserian
stanza. Milton keeps us in better company than
this, even in Hell. He uses abstract terms magnificently,
but almost always with a reference to
concrete realities, not as the names of separate
entities. By the substitution of abstract nouns for
concrete he achieves a wonderful effect of majesty.
He does not name, for instance, the particular
form of wind instrument that the heralds blew in
Hell:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t8">Four speedy Cherubim</div>
<div class="t0">Put to their mouths the sounding alchymy.</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_228">[228]</div>

<p>He avoids defining his creatures by names that
lend themselves to definite picture: of Death he
says--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">So spake the grisly Terror;</div>
</div>

<p>and he makes Raphael, at the call of Heaven's
king, rise</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t5">from among</div>
<div class="t0">Thousand celestial Ardours.</div>
</div>

<p>In the Tenth Book, Death, snuffing the distant
scent of mortality, becomes all nose--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">So scented the grim Feature, and upturned</div>
<div class="t0">His nostril wide into the murky air.</div>
</div>

<p>A superb example of this powerful use of
abstract terms is contained in the First Book of
<i>Paradise Regained</i>, where is described how Satan,
disguised as an old man, took his leave of the Son
of God, and</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t8">Bowing low</div>
<div class="t0">His gray dissimulation, disappeared</div>
<div class="t0">Into thin air diffused.</div>
</div>

<p>The word "dissimulation" expresses the fact
of the gray hairs assumed, the purpose of deceit,
the cringing attitude, and adds a vague effect of
power. The same vagueness is habitually studied
by Milton in such phrases as "the vast abrupt,"
"the palpable obscure," "the void immense," "the
wasteful deep," where, by the use of an adjective
<span class="pb" id="pg_229">[229]</span>
in place of a substantive, the danger of a definite
and inadequate conception is avoided.</p>

<p>Milton, therefore, describes the concrete, the
specific, the individual, using general and abstract
terms for the sake of the dignity and scope that
they lend. The best of our Romantic poets follow
the opposite course: they are much concerned with
abstract conceptions and general truths, but they
bring them home by the employment of concrete
and specific terms, and figures so familiar that they
cannot easily avoid grotesque associations. These
grotesque associations, however trivial, are the
delight of humour: Alexander's dust will stop
a beer-barrel; divine ambition exposes</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t6">what is mortal and unsure</div>
<div class="t0">To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,</div>
<div class="t0">Even for an egg-shell.</div>
</div>

<p>The comments made by Johnson on a certain
well-known passage in <i>Macbeth</i> are an excellent
example of the objections urged against the
Romantic method--a method whereby, says Johnson,
poetry is "debased by mean expressions."
He takes for text the invocation of Night by Lady
Macbeth--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t8">Come, thick night,</div>
<div class="t0">And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,</div>
<div class="t0">That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,</div>
<div class="t0">Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,</div>
<div class="t0">To cry, "Hold, hold!"</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_230">[230]</div>

<p>Johnson's criticisms, which take up a whole
paper in <i>The Rambler</i>, may be conveniently stated
in summary. The epithet <i>dun</i>, he says, is "an
epithet now seldom heard but in the stable, and
<i>dun</i> night may come and go without any other
notice but contempt." A <i>knife</i>, again, is "an
instrument used by butchers and cooks in the
meanest employments; we do not immediately
conceive that any crime of importance is to be
committed with a <i>knife</i>." In the third place,
although to wish to elude the eye of Providence
is "the utmost extravagance of determined wickedness,"
yet even this great conception is debased by
two unfortunate words when the avengers of guilt
are made to <i>peep</i> through a <i>blanket</i>.</p>

<p>It is easy, in this case at least, to defend
Shakespeare. There is no need to make much
of the fact that Johnson attributes the speech to
Macbeth. The essence of the crime is that it is
the treacherous and cowardly crime of an assassin,
committed on a guest while he sleeps. Implements
of war are out of place here; it is the very
crime for a knife, and Lady Macbeth shows her
sense of this when she uses the word. Again, the
darkness that she invokes is not the solemn shadow
of night, but the stifling, opaque smoke of Hell.
The blanket was perhaps suggested to Shakespeare
by the black canopy that hung over the Elizabethan
stage to represent night; but, in any case,
<span class="pb" id="pg_231">[231]</span>
it gives the notion of an artificial privacy, shutting
out light and shutting in sound, a smothered unnatural
secrecy. The use of the word <i>blanket</i>, in
fact, carries with it a new fantastic horror. Night
herself, who has brought the fatal gift of sleep to
Duncan, is represented as the cowardly accomplice
of the murderers, performing the most dastardly
office that can fall to the hireling of a bravo.</p>

<p>The mean associations, therefore, in so far as
they exist, help Shakespeare's purpose. Milton
had no purpose that could be furthered by such
help. The omissions in his descriptions cannot be
supplied by an appeal to experience, for what he
describes is outside the pale of human experience,
and is, in that sense, unreal. His descriptions do
not so much remind us of what we have seen as
create for us what we are to see. He is bound,
therefore, to avoid the slightest touch of unworthy
association; the use of even a few domestic figures
and homely phrases would bring his hanging palace
about his ears. What dangers he escaped may be
well seen in Cowley's <i>Davideis</i>, which fell into
them all. This is how Cowley describes the
attiring of his Gabriel, who is commissioned to
bear a message to David--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">He took for skin a cloud most soft and bright,</div>
<div class="t0">That e'er the midday Sun pierced through with light:</div>
<div class="t0">Upon his cheeks a lively blush he spred;</div>
<div class="t0">Washt from the morning beauties deepest red.</div>
<span class="pb" id="pg_232">[232]</span>
<div class="t0">An harmless flaming <i>Meteor</i> shone for haire,</div>
<div class="t0">And fell adown his shoulders with loose care.</div>
<div class="t0">He cuts out a silk <i>Mantle</i> from the skies,</div>
<div class="t0">Where the most sprightly azure pleas'd the eyes.</div>
<div class="t0">This he with starry vapours spangles all,</div>
<div class="t0">Took in their prime ere they grow <i>ripe</i> and <i>fall</i>,--</div>
</div>

<p>--and so on. The whole business suggests the
arming of Pigwiggin; or the intricacies of Belinda's
toilet in <i>The Rape of the Lock</i>. Such a Gabriel
should add the last touch of adornment from a
patch-box filled with sun-spots; and then is fit
only to be--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Drawn with a team of little atomies</div>
<div class="t0">Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep.</div>
</div>

<p>Milton was not in the least likely to fall into
this fantastic-familiar vein. But he was also debarred
from dealing freely in realism; from carrying
conviction by some sudden startling piece of
fidelity to the mixed texture of human experience
and human feeling. When the feast is spread in
Eden he remarks, it is true,--"No fear lest dinner
cool"; but a lapse like this is of the rarest. His
success--and he knew it--depended on the untiring
maintenance of a superhuman elevation.
His choice of subject had therefore not a little to
do with the nature of his diction; and, through
the influence of his diction, as shall be shown
hereafter, with the establishment of the poetic
<span class="pb" id="pg_233">[233]</span>
tradition that dominated Eighteenth Century
poetry.</p>

<p>The same motives and tendencies, the same
consistent care for remoteness and loftiness, may
be seen in the character of the similes that he most
frequently employs. Almost all his figures and
comparisons illustrate concrete objects by concrete
objects, and occurrences in time by other occurrences
later in time. The essentially Romantic
sort of figure, scarcely used by Milton, illustrates
subtle conceptual relations by parable--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Now at the last gasp of Love's latest breath,</div>
<div class="t0">When, his pulse failing, Passion speechless lies,</div>
<div class="t0">And Faith is kneeling by his bed of death,</div>
<div class="t0">And Innocence is closing up his eyes,--</div>
<div class="t0">Now, if thou would'st, when all have given him over,</div>
<div class="t0">From death to life thou might'st him yet recover.</div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes, by a curious reversal, poets, especially
the more sophisticated poets of the Romantic
Revival, describe a perfectly definite outward object
or scene by a figure drawn from the most complex
abstract conceptions. So Shelley, with whom these
inverted figures are habitual, compares the skylark
to</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t3">A poet hidden</div>
<div class="t0">In the light of thought;</div>
</div>

<p>and Byron, describing the rainbow over a waterfall,
likens it to</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Love watching Madness with unalterable mien.</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_234">[234]</div>

<p>Both ways are foreign to the epic manner of
Milton. His figures may be called historic
parallels, whereby the names and incidents of
human history are made to elucidate and ennoble
the less familiar names and incidents of his prehistoric
theme. Sometimes, following Homer, he
borrows a figure from rustic life, as where, for
instance, he compares the devils, crowding into
Pandemonium, to a swarm of bees. But he perceived
clearly enough that he could not, for the
reasons already explained, afford to deal largely in
this class of figure: he prefers to maintain dignity
and distance by choosing comparisons from ancient
history and mythology, or from those great and
strange things in Nature which repel intimacy--the
sun, the moon, the sea, planets in opposition,
a shooting star, an evening mist, a will-o'-the-wisp,
a vulture descending from the Himalayas, the ice-floes
on the North-East passage, the sea-beast
leviathan, Xerxes' Hellespontic bridge, the gryphon
pursuing the Arimaspian, the madness of Alcides
in Oeta, the rape of Proserpine, and a hundred
more reminiscences of the ancient world.</p>

<p>Even the great events of ancient history seemed
to him at times too familiar, too little elevated and
remote to furnish a resting-place for a song that
intended "no middle flight." He transforms his
proper names, both to make them more melodious,
and to make them more unfamiliar to the ear.
<span class="pb" id="pg_235">[235]</span>
No praise is too high for his art and skill in this
matter. An example may be found in those four
lines--the earliest that have the full Miltonic
resonance--describing the fate of Lycidas, carried
by the tide southward to the Cornish coast:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,</div>
<div class="t0">Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old,</div>
<div class="t0">Where the great Vision of the guarded mount</div>
<div class="t0">Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold.</div>
</div>

<p>"Bellerus" seems to be a name of Milton's
coinage. He had written "Corineus," and
probably disliked the sound, for in this case it can
hardly have been that the name was too familiar.
Both reasons concurred in prompting the allusion
to Pharaoh and his Egyptian squadrons as--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Busiris and his Memphian chivalry.</div>
</div>

<p>One would think "Italy" a pleasant enough sound,
and "Vulcan" a good enough name for poetry.
Neither was musical enough for Milton; both
perhaps had associations too numerous, familiar,
and misleading. Vulcan is mentioned, by that
name, in <i>Comus</i>; but in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, where the
story of his fall from Heaven is told, and the
architect of Pandemonium is identified with him,
both names, "Italy" and "Vulcan," are heightened
and improved:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t8">In Ausonian land</div>
<div class="t0">Men called him Mulciber.</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_236">[236]</div>

<p>"Hephaistos," the name dear to moderns, could
have found no place in Milton's works, unless it
had been put in a description of the God's smithy,
or, perhaps, in the sonnet where are pilloried those
harsh-sounding Presbyterian names:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Collkitto, or Macdonnel, or Galasp.</div>
</div>

<p>Milton's use of proper names is a measure of his
poetic genius. He does not forego it even in the
lyric. Was there ever so learned a lyric as that
beginning "Sabrina fair"--with its rich stores of
marine mythology? History, not philosophy, was
the source that he drew on for his splendours; and
history, according to Milton, had, since the Fall of
Man, furnished nothing but fainter and weaker
repetitions of those stupendous events which filled
the early theatre of universal space.</p>

<p>His epic catalogues, which are few in number,
show the same predominant interest in history and
geography. The story of the Creation gave him
an excellent opportunity of enumerating the kinds
and properties of birds, beasts, fishes, and reptiles,
plants and trees, after the manner of Chaucer and
Spenser. This opportunity he refuses, or, at any
rate, turns to but small account. His general
descriptions are highly picturesque, but he spends
little time on enumeration and detail. Of vegetables,
only the vine, the gourd, and the corn are
mentioned by name; of the inhabitants of the sea
<span class="pb" id="pg_237">[237]</span>
only the seal, the dolphin, and the whale. Natural
knowledge, although he made a fair place for it in
his scheme of education, was not one of his dearer
studies. It was enough for him, as for Raphael,
that Adam knew the natures of the beasts, and
gave them appropriate names. The mere mention,
on the other hand, of historic and geographic
names rouses all the poet in him. The splendid
roll-call of the devils, in the First Book of
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, and the only less splendid enumeration,
in the Eleventh Book, of the Kingdoms of
the Earth, shown to Adam in vision, are a standing
testimony to his powers. Compared with these,
the list of human diseases and maladies in the
Eleventh Book, suggested perhaps by Du Bartas,
is rehearsed in a slighter and more perfunctory
fashion.</p>

<p>One last point in Milton's treatment must not
be left unnoticed. Much adverse criticism has
been spent on his allegorical figures of Sin and
Death. There is good classical precedent for the
introduction of such personified abstractions among
the actors of a drama; and, seeing that the introduction
of sin and death into the world was the
chief effect of his main action, Milton no doubt
felt that this too must be handled in right epic
fashion, and must not be left to be added to the
theme as a kind of embroidery of moral philosophy.
In no other way could he have treated the topic
<span class="pb" id="pg_238">[238]</span>
half so effectively. There is enough of his
philosophy in Milton's Heaven to damp our
desire for more of it on his Earth or in his Hell.
And when once we have given him license to deal
only in persons, we are amply rewarded. His
management of the poetic figure of personification
is superb. It is a figure difficult to handle, and
generally fails of effect through falling into one of
two extremes. Either the quality, or the person,
is forgotten. The figures in the <i>Romaunt of the
Rose</i> are good examples of the one type, of the
minute materialistic personifications of the Middle
Ages, pictorial rather than literary in essence, like
the illuminated figures in a psalter. The feeble
abstractions that people Gray's Odes, where, as
Coleridge remarked, the personification depends
wholly on the use of an initial capital, are examples
of the other. Neither has the art of combining the
vastness and vagueness of the abstract with the
precise and definite conception of a person, as is
done in the great figure of Religion drawn by
Lucretius, as is done also in those other figures--the
only creations of English poetry which approach
the Latin in grandeur--the horrible phantoms of
Sin and Death.</p>

<p>These, then, here outlined slightly and imperfectly,
are some of the most noteworthy features
of Milton's style. By the measured roll of his
verse, and the artful distribution of stress and pause
<span class="pb" id="pg_239">[239]</span>
to avoid monotony and to lift the successive lines
in a climax; by the deliberate and choice character
of his diction, and his wealth of vaguely emotional
epithets; by the intuition which taught him to use
no figures that do not heighten the majesty, and
no names that do not help the music of his poem;
by the vivid outlines of the concrete imaginations
that he imposes on us for real, and the cloudy
brilliance that he weaves for them out of all great
historical memories, and all far-reaching abstract
conceptions, he attained to a finished style of
perhaps a more consistent and unflagging elevation
than is to be found elsewhere in literature. There
is nothing to put beside him. "His natural port,"
says Johnson, "is gigantick loftiness." And
Landor: "After I have been reading the <i>Paradise
Lost</i>, I can take up no other poet with satisfaction.
I seem to have left the music of Handel for the
music of the streets, or, at best, for drums and
fifes." The secret of the style is lost; and no
poet, since Milton's day, has recaptured the
solemnity and beauty of the large utterance of
Gabriel, or Belial, or Satan.</p>

<hr />

<p>The success of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, when it was
published in 1667, was immediate and startling.
Some of the poet's biographers have shed tears
over the ten pounds that was all Milton ever
received for his greatest work; others, magnanimously
<span class="pb" id="pg_240">[240]</span>
renouncing the world on his behalf,
have rejoiced in the smallness of the sum paid him
for a priceless work. Lament and heroics are
both out of place. London was a small town,
and it may well be doubted whether any modern
provincial town of the same size would buy up in
eighteen months thirteen hundred copies of a
poem so serious and difficult and novel as <i>Paradise
Lost</i>. Moreover, before the close of the century,
six editions had appeared, three of them in folio, and
so--judged by the number of editions--Milton's
epic had outrun Shakespeare's plays in popularity.
The folio edition of 1695, with notes and elucidations
by one Patrick Hume, a Scottish scholar,
appeared fourteen years before Nicholas Rowe
produced the first critical edition of Shakespeare.
The literary world quickly came to the opinion
expressed by Dryden in the year of Milton's
death, that the <i>Paradise Lost</i> was "one of the
greatest, most noble, and most sublime poems
which either this age or nation has produced."
Barely twenty years later the editors of the
<i>Athenian Mercury</i> were asked to determine
"Whether Milton and Waller were not the best
English Poets; and which the better of the
two?" Their verdict, reflecting, no doubt, the
average opinion of the time, ran thus: "They
were both excellent in their kind, and exceeded
each other, and all besides. Milton was the
<span class="pb" id="pg_241">[241]</span>
fullest and loftiest; Waller the neatest and most
correct poet we ever had." Long before Addison
wrote the papers on <i>Paradise Lost</i> in the <i>Spectator</i>,
Milton had received full recognition in the literary
handbooks of that age. Langbaine, in his <i>Account
of the English Dramatick Poets</i> (1691), takes notice
of Dryden's debts to <i>Samson Agonistes</i>, and, with
an effort to be just, remarks of Milton:--" Had
his Principles been as good as his Parts, he had
been an Excellent Person." Sir Thomas Pope
Blount, in his <i>De Re Poetica</i> (1694), and Bysshe
in his <i>Art of English Poetry</i> (1702), bear witness,
in their several ways, to Milton's great and
assured fame. Indeed, Thomas Rymer, of Gray's
Inn, Esquire, who in 1677 had sneered at "that
Paradise Lost of Milton's which some are pleased
to call a Poem," and William Winstanley, who,
in the <i>Lives of the Most Famous English Poets</i>
(1687), had remarked of Milton that "his Fame
is gone out like a Candle in a Snuff, and his
Memory will always stink," were almost alone
among the voices of their time. They were still
under the influence of the old political prejudice,
but they did battle for a doomed opinion, and,
among judges not illiterate, they are the poet's
last detractors.</p>

<p>The singular thing to note is that the eighteenth
century, which broke with almost every other
seventeenth-century poet before Dryden, did not
<span class="pb" id="pg_242">[242]</span>
break with Milton. "Who now reads Cowley?"
Pope asked: Cowley, whose works ran through so
many editions that no modern reprint has been
called for. If he had asked, "Who now reads
Milton?" the answer must have been, "Every
writer of English verse"; and so it has continued
from the time of Milton's death to the present
day. The choice of blank verse for <i>Paradise
Lost</i> established that metre in formidable rivalry
to the heroic couplet, so that it became the usual
metre for long poems of a reflective or descriptive
cast. Professed imitations of Milton's verse were
many; among them, Addison's <i>Translation of a
Story out of the Third Aeneid</i>, Broome's experiment
in the translation of the Eleventh Odyssey,
Fenton's fragments of two books of the <i>Iliad</i>,
and Christopher Pitt's paraphrase of Psalm cxxxix.
In the first year of the eighteenth century John
Philips showed, in his <i>Splendid Shilling</i>, how the
style of Milton might be applied, for the purposes
of burlesque, to humble subjects, a lesson which
he further illustrated, with no ostensible comic
intent, in his later poems, <i>Cyder</i> and <i>Blenheim</i>.
Gay, in <i>Wine, a Poem</i>, Somerville in <i>The Chase</i>,
Armstrong in <i>The Oeconomy of Love</i> and <i>The Art
of Preserving Health</i>, Christopher Smart in The
Hop-Garden, Dyer in <i>The Fleece</i>, and Grainger in
<i>The Sugar-Cane</i>, all followed where Philips' <i>Cyder</i>
had led, and multiplied year by year what may
<span class="pb" id="pg_243">[243]</span>
be called the technical and industrial applications
of Milton's style. Among the many other blank
verse poems produced during the middle part of
the century it is enough to name Thomson's
<i>Seasons</i>; Blair's <i>Grave</i>; Glover's <i>Leonidas</i>; Shenstone's
<i>Economy</i>, <i>The Ruined Abbey</i>, and <i>Love and
Honour</i>; Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i>; Akenside's
<i>Pleasures of the Imagination</i>; Thomas Warton's
<i>Pleasures of Melancholy</i>; Mallet's <i>The Excursion</i>,
and <i>Amyntor and Theodora</i>; Cooper's <i>The Power
of Harmony</i>; and Lyttelton's <i>Blenheim</i>. The
influence of Milton is not equally apparent in all
of these, but in none is it wholly wanting; in most
it is visible on every page. The mere invocation
often tells a tale. Thus Akenside:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Thou chief, Poetic Spirit, from the banks</div>
<div class="t0">Of Avon, whence thy holy fingers cull</div>
<div class="t0">Fresh flowers and dews to sprinkle on the turf</div>
<div class="t0">Where Shakespeare lies, be present. And with thee</div>
<div class="t0">Let Fiction come; on her a&euml;rial wings</div>
<div class="t0">Wafting ten thousand colours.</div>
</div>

<p>The quotation need not be prolonged; even while
he commemorates Shakespeare, Akenside goes to
Milton for his material, and plays a feeble variation
on the Miltonic phrase:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t7">In his right hand</div>
<div class="t0">Grasping ten thousand thunders.</div>
</div>

<p>Thus Lyttelton:--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_244">[244]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Minerva, thee to my adventurous lyre</div>
<div class="t0">Assistant I invoke, that means to sing</div>
<div class="t0">Blenheim, proud monument of British fame</div>
<div class="t0">Thy glorious work!</div>
</div>

<p>"The building, not the field, I sing," he might
have added, for Philips had already chanted the
battle of Blenheim in like Miltonic fashion.
Thus, again, the worthy Grainger, flattest of
agricultural bards:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Spirit of Inspiration, that did'st lead</div>
<div class="t0">Th' Ascrean poet to the sacred mount,</div>
<div class="t0">And taught'st him all the precepts of the swain;</div>
<div class="t0">Descend from Heaven, and guide my trembling steps</div>
<div class="t0">To Fame's eternal dome, where Maro reigns;</div>
<div class="t0">Where pastoral Dyer, where Pomona's bard,</div>
<div class="t0">And Smart and Somervile in varying strains,</div>
<div class="t0">Their sylvan lore convey: O may I join</div>
<div class="t0">This choral band, and from their precepts learn</div>
<div class="t0">To deck my theme, which though to song unknown,</div>
<div class="t0">Is most momentous to my country's weal!</div>
</div>

<p>Grainger frequently echoes Milton; and in the
passage where he addresses the Avon, at Bristol,
he pays a more explicit tribute:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Though not to you, young Shakespeare, Fancy's child,</div>
<div class="t0">All-rudely warbled his first woodland notes;</div>
<div class="t0"><span class="gsw">*      *      *      *      *</span></div>
<div class="t0">On you reclined, another tuned his pipe,</div>
<div class="t0">Whom all the Muses emulously love,</div>
<div class="t0">And in whose strains your praises shall endure</div>
<div class="t0">While to Sabrina speeds your healing stream.</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_245">[245]</div>

<p>Better and more striking instances of the Miltonic
spell laid on blank verse are easily to be found for
the seeking. But since it is the omnipresence of
this Miltonic influence that is asserted, passages
like these, which catch the eye on any chance
page of eighteenth-century blank verse, and are
representative of hundreds more, suffice for the
purpose.</p>

<p>There has been a tendency among recent historians
of English literature to group together
the poets who, like Dyer in <i>Grongar Hill</i>, and
Thomas Warton in <i>The Pleasures of Melancholy</i>,
echo the strains of Milton's early poems, and
to name them "Miltonics," precursors of the
Romantic Revival. No doubt there is a marked
difference between Milton's earlier manner and
his later; not a few of his lovers, if they were
forced to choose, would readily give up the three
major poems to save the five best of the minor.
But it is going far to appropriate the name of
"Miltonic" to imitators of the earlier poems.
Perhaps the study of <i>L'Allegro</i> and <i>Il Penseroso</i>
and <i>Comus</i> helped forward the Romantic Revival;
but the chief influence of Milton on the development
of English poetry was not this. It was
natural enough that those who had been taught
from childhood to read and admire <i>Paradise Lost</i>
should find relief and novelty in the freer and more
spontaneous music of these youthful poems. But
<span class="pb" id="pg_246">[246]</span>
the truth is that before ever he abetted the escape,
he helped to forge the fetters; that Milton, as
much as any other single writer, was responsible
for the wide and potent sway of the classical
convention.</p>

<p>Above all, he may fairly be called the inventor
and, by the irony of fate, the promulgator of that
"poetic diction" which, in the time of its deformity
and decay, Wordsworth sought to destroy.
Johnson attributes the invention to Dryden.
"There was therefore," he says, "before the time
of Dryden no poetical diction, no system of words,
at once refined from the grossness of domestick
use, and free from the harshness of terms appropriated
to particular arts. Words too familiar or
too remote defeat the purpose of a poet."</p>

<p>There is no need to quarrel with this account,
if we are careful to understand exactly what
Johnson means. Dryden, he says in effect, wrote
plain, well-bred English; he eschewed technical
terms, shunned the florid licenses of the Elizabethans,
and yet, in his more studied verse, never
dropped into the town-gallant vein of some of his
contemporaries, the slang of Butler or Lestrange.
Johnson, it should be remembered, thought the
diction of <i>Lycidas</i> "harsh," and it is plain enough
from many of his utterances that he ranged Milton
with the poets who use words and phrases "too
remote" from the language of natural intercourse.
<span class="pb" id="pg_247">[247]</span>
He was a devoted adherent of the school of
Dryden and Pope; in the <i>Lives of the Poets</i> he
loses no opportunity of expressing his contempt
for blank verse; he was only too likely to exalt
the influence of his masters on the poets of his
own time, and to ignore the influence of Milton.
Since handbooks of literature are commonly formed
by a process of attrition from such works as
Johnson's <i>Lives</i>, his opinions on a point like this
persist in epidemic fashion; they are detached
from their authority, and repeated so often that
at last they become orthodox. But no ignoring
of Milton can alter the fact that English verse
went Milton-mad during the earlier half of the
eighteenth century. Miltonic cadences became a
kind of patter, and the diction that Milton had
invented for the rendering of his colossal imaginations
was applied indifferently to all subjects--to
apple-growing, sugar-boiling, the drainage of the
Bedford level, the breeding of negroes, and the
distempers of sheep. Milton's shadowy grandeur,
his avoidance of plain concrete terms, his manner
of linking adjective with substantive, were all
necessary to him for the describing of his strange
world; but these habits became a mere vicious
trick of absurd periphrasis and purposeless vagueness
when they were carried by his imitators into
the description of common and familiar objects.
A reader making his first acquaintance with
<span class="pb" id="pg_248">[248]</span>
Thomson's <i>Seasons</i> might suppose that the poem
was written for a wager, to prove that country life
may be described, and nothing called by its name.
The philosophic pride of the eighteenth century
was tickled by the use of general terms in description;
the chosen periphrases are always more
comprehensive than the names that they replace.
When Thomson, for instance, speaks of "the
feathered nations" or of "the glossy kind," it is
only by the context that we are saved from
supposing him to allude, in the one case to Red
Indians, in the other to moles. And these are
but two of some dozen devices for escaping from
the flat vulgarity of calling birds by that name.</p>

<p>Milton himself, it must be admitted, is not
wholly free from blame. The elevation and vagueness
of his diction, which were a mere necessity to
him in the treatment of large parts of his subject,
are yet maintained by him in the description of
things comparatively familiar. When Sin is described
as "rolling her bestial train" towards the
gates of Hell, the diction is faultless; when the
serpent (as yet an innocent reptile in Paradise),</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine</div>
<div class="t0">His braided train,</div>
</div>

<p>it is impossible to cavil; but when Raphael, in
conversation with Adam, describes the formation
of the banks--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_249">[249]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t9">where rivers now</div>
<div class="t0">Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train,</div>
</div>

<p>criticism is less at ease. We feel that we are
drawing near to the "poetic diction" of the
eighteenth century. Eve's tears are called</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t6">precious drops that ready stood</div>
<div class="t0">Each in their crystal sluice,</div>
</div>

<p>but the description is saved by the lines that
immediately precede, where Milton says the word,
and thereby shows that he is not seeking idle
periphrasis:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">But silently a gentle tear let fall</div>
<div class="t0">From either eye, and wiped them with her hair.</div>
</div>

<p>His constant preference for words of Latin origin
certainly brings Milton near at times to the poetic
diction banned by Wordsworth. "Vernal bloom"
for "spring flowers," "humid bow" for "rainbow,"
the description of the brooks rolling--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">With mazy error under pendent shades,</div>
</div>

<p>the use of phrases like "nitrous powder" or
"smutty grain" for "gunpowder," and "optic
glass" or "optic tube" for the telescope or "perspective,"
are instances of the approximation. A
certain number of these circuitous phrases are
justified by considerations of dramatic propriety.
When Raphael describes the artillery used in
Heaven, he speaks of cannon balls as "iron globes"
<span class="pb" id="pg_250">[250]</span>
and "balls of missive ruin," and calls the linstock
the "incentive reed pernicious," thereby perhaps
drawing attention to the strange character of the
new invention. No such reason can be invoked
for his justification when he tells how the sun
receives from earth</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t5">his alimental recompense</div>
<div class="t0">In humid exhalations;</div>
</div>

<p>still less when, speaking of food, with which he
confesses himself to be familiar, he calls it "corporal
nutriment."</p>

<p>But the chief sinner is Adam. If the evil
passions of the rebel Angels invented the pun, it
was the pomposity of our father Adam that first
brought "poetic diction" into vogue. When the
curse has fallen in Eden he makes a long speech
for the comfort of Eve, in the course of which he
alludes to "the graceful locks of these fair spreading
trees," speaks of the sun as "this diurnal
star," and, studying protection against the newly
experienced cold, advises--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t4">how we his gathered beams</div>
<div class="t0">Reflected may with matter sere foment,</div>
<div class="t0">Or by collision of two bodies grind</div>
<div class="t0">The air attrite to fire;</div>
</div>

<p>--for all the world as if he were a man of science
lecturing to some Philosophic Institute on the
customs of savages.</p>

<p>If, then, the term "poetic diction" is to be
<span class="pb" id="pg_251">[251]</span>
used as Wordsworth used it, Johnson's account of
its origin must be amended. There was little or
no poetic diction, of the kind condemned by
Wordsworth, before the time of Milton. In the
Elizabethan age all diction was free to poetry, and
was freely used. Drawing on his accumulated
stores of literary reminiscence, and using them for
his own special purpose, Milton invented "poetic
diction," and bore a main part in the founding of
the English school of poetry which is called
"Classical." His diction is called "poetic,"
because it was absolutely fitted to his purpose,
which could have been conceived only by the
loftiest poetic genius. His style was admired,
misunderstood, and imitated for a century. The
diction of his imitators is called "poetic," because,
for the most part, they believed that dull nonsense
and trading platitudes could be made into poetry
by a borrowed system of diction.</p>

<p>Even the best poets of the age are not freer
than the rest from the baneful Miltonic infection.
Coleridge found the source of "our pseudo-poetic
diction" in Pope's <i>Homer</i>. But Pope was from
boyhood a sedulous student of Milton, and a
frequent borrower. The mock-heroics of the
<i>Dunciad</i> are stilted on Miltonic phrases; and in
the translation of Homer, above all, reminiscences
of Milton abound. In most of them Milton's
phraseology is weakened and misapplied. Two
<span class="pb" id="pg_252">[252]</span>
instances among many may serve. When Vulcan,
in the First Iliad, warns Juno against rousing the
anger of Jove, he adds:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Once in your cause I felt his matchless might,</div>
<div class="t0">Hurled headlong downward from th' ethereal height.</div>
</div>

<p>The word "flaming" in Milton's splendid line
did not suit Pope's purpose--so it disappears, and
with it half the glory of the original. In place of
it, to eke out the syllables, he inserts the idle, if
not foolish, substitute "downward." This is the
art of sinking in poetry. Again, Ulysses, narrating
his adventures, in the Ninth Odyssey, remarks:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">In vain Calypso long constrained my stay,</div>
<div class="t0">With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay.</div>
</div>

<p>The whole line, so beautiful when it describes the
modesty of Eve, in its new context becomes stark
nonsense. It is Ulysses who is "reluctant," and
Calypso who is "amorous." The misuse of
Milton's line makes the situation comic.</p>

<p>James Thomson (to take another example)
with a genuine thin vein of originality, too often
conceals it under Miltonic lendings. The trail of
<i>Paradise Lost</i> runs all through <i>The Seasons</i>. In
such a description as this of the Moon in Autumn
there is a cluster of reminiscences:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">Meanwhile the Moon</div>
<div class="t0">Full-orbed and breaking through the scattered clouds,</div>
<span class="pb" id="pg_253">[253]</span>
<div class="t0">Shows her broad visage in the crimsoned east.</div>
<div class="t0">Turned to the Sun direct, her spotted disk,</div>
<div class="t0">Where mountains rise, umbrageous dales descend,</div>
<div class="t0">And caverns deep, as optic tube descries,</div>
<div class="t0">A smaller Earth, gives all his blaze again,</div>
<div class="t0">Void of its flame, and sheds a softer day.</div>
</div>

<p>Thomson could not resist the attractions of
Milton's stately Latin vocabulary. Where Milton
describes how, in Paradise--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t10">the flowery lap</div>
<div class="t0">Of some irriguous valley spread her store;</div>
</div>

<p>Thomson follows with--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">See where the winding vale its lavish stores</div>
<div class="t0">Irriguous spreads.</div>
</div>

<p>Where Milton describes how Satan, wounded by Michael--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t4">writhed him to and fro convolved,</div>
</div>

<p>Thomson follows with a description of the Spring meadows, where</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t10">the sportive lambs</div>
<div class="t0">This way and that convolved, in friskful glee</div>
<div class="t0">Their frolics play.</div>
</div>

<p>The lambs emulating Satan are a kind of epitome
and emblem of those descriptive poets of the
eighteenth century who took Milton for their
model.</p>

<p>But perhaps the best example of all is Gray,
whose work is full of Miltonic reminiscence. He
<span class="pb" id="pg_254">[254]</span>
frequently borrows; and, like Pope, almost always
spoils in the borrowing. Thus what Milton
writes of the nightingale--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">She all night long her amorous descant sung,--</div>
</div>

<p>is echoed by Gray in the <i>Sonnet on the Death of
Richard West</i>:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">The birds in vain their amorous descant join.</div>
</div>

<p>Now a "descant" is a variation imposed upon a
plain-song. The word exactly describes the song
of the nightingale; but the addition of the verb
"join" robs it of all meaning. Again, the passage
in the Second Book of <i>Paradise Lost</i> where Moloch
describes the pains of Hell--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t7">when the scourge</div>
<div class="t0">Inexorably, and the torturing hour</div>
<div class="t0">Calls us to penance,--</div>
</div>

<p>lingered in Gray's memory when he addressed
Adversity--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Whose iron scourge and torturing hour</div>
<div class="t0">The bad affright, afflict the best.</div>
</div>

<p>The "torturing hour" in Gray's line becomes
one of the chance possessions of Adversity, suspended
from her belt with the rest of her trinkets.
Observe how the word "hour" has been emptied of
its meaning. It affrights one class of persons, and
afflicts another, which anything that is "torturing"
<span class="pb" id="pg_255">[255]</span>
might easily do. In Milton the most awful
property of Time is indicated; the hour "calls--inexorably."
Here, then, in two cases, is plagiarism,
which may be defined as unblest theft--the
theft of what you do not want, and cannot use.</p>

<p>In these and many other passages of eighteenth-century
verse it may be seen how literary reminiscence
sometimes strangles poetry; and how a
great man suffers at the hands of his disciples and
admirers. The thing has happened so often that
it ceases to cause surprise; were not Lydgate and
Occleve pupils (save the mark!) of Chaucer?
And yet it remains a paradox that Milton's, of all
styles in the world, unapproachable in its loftiness,
invented by a temper of the most burning zeal
and the profoundest gravity for the treatment of a
subject wildly intractable by ordinary methods,
should have been chosen by a generation of philosophical
organ-grinders as the fittest pattern for
their professional melodies; and that a system of
diction employed by a blind man for the description
of an imaginary world should have been
borrowed by landscape-gardeners and travelling
pedlars for the setting forth of their works and
their wares.</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_256">[256]</div>


<h2><a id="c7">EPILOGUE</a></h2>

<p>In the meantime, while Dryden and Milton both
had their schools, most of our seventeenth-century
poetry fell into an almost complete oblivion. Dryden's
satiric, and Milton's epic strains engrossed
attention, and shaped the verses of an age. But
the seventeenth century was extraordinarily wealthy
in poetic kinds quite distinct from these: in metaphysic,
and mysticism, in devotional ecstasy, and
love-lyric, and romance. The English genius
in poetry is essentially metaphysical and romantic.
Milton was neither. He could not have excelled
in any of these kinds; nor have come near to
Suckling, or Crashaw, or Vaughan, or Herrick, or
Marvell, in their proper realms. It is a permissible
indulgence, therefore, in taking leave of
Milton, to turn from the <i>Paradise Lost</i> for a
moment, and, escaping from the solid materialism
of the heroic and epic strain, to find passion once
more among the Court lyrists, and spiritual insight
among the retired mystics, to find Religion and
Love, and the humility that has access to both.
<span class="pb" id="pg_257">[257]</span>
A profound humility, impossible to Milton, inspired
Vaughan when he wrote such a verse as
this:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t3">There is in God, some say,</div>
<div class="t0">A deep but dazzling darkness; as men here</div>
<div class="t0">Say it is late and dusky, because they</div>
<div class="t3">See not all clear.</div>
<div class="t0">O for that night! where I in him</div>
<div class="t0">Might live invisible and dim!</div>
</div>

<p>There is a natural vision, and there is a spiritual
vision; the spiritual belongs to Vaughan, not to
Milton. If Milton persuades us to a willing
suspension of disbelief for the moment, Vaughan
thrills us with a sense of vivid reality. His <i>Ascension
Day</i> is a thing seen, as if it were a memory of
yesterday:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">The day-star smiles, and light, with thee deceast,</div>
<div class="t0">Now shines in all the chambers of the East.</div>
<div class="t0">What stirs, what posting intercourse and mirth</div>
<div class="t0">Of Saints and Angels glorifie the earth!</div>
<div class="t0">What sighs, what whispers, busie stops and stays;</div>
<div class="t0">Private and holy talk fill all the ways!</div>
<div class="t0">They pass as at the last great day, and run</div>
<div class="t0">In their white robes to seek the risen Sun;</div>
<div class="t0">I see them, hear them, mark their haste, and move</div>
<div class="t0">Amongst them, with them, wing'd with faith and love.</div>
</div>

<p>To the intensity of his aspiration and hushed
expectance the world seems only a turbulent
passing pageant, or a hard wayfaring, suffered in
a dream:--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_258">[258]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t12">Who stays</div>
<div class="t0">Here long must passe</div>
<div class="t0">O'er dark hills, swift streames, and steep ways</div>
<div class="t5">As smooth as glasse.</div>
</div>

<p>Or a brief sickness:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">So for this night I linger here,</div>
<div class="t0">And, full of tossings to and fro,</div>
<div class="t0">Expect still when thou wilt appear,</div>
<div class="t0">That I may get me up and go.</div>
</div>

<p>His eyes are fixed on the shining lights that beckon
him; the world is full of voices, but its sights and
sounds appeal to him in vain; the beauties that
surround him are things of naught--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Glorious deceptions, gilded mists,</div>
<div class="t0">False joyes, phantastick flights.</div>
</div>

<p>In the distance before him there shines</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t5">An air of glory</div>
<div class="t0">Whose light doth trample on my days;</div>
<div class="t0">My days, which are at best but dull and hoary,</div>
<div class="t5">Meer glimmering and decays;</div>
</div>

<p>and he lifts up his voice in passionate desire for
the ultimate deliverance:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Ah! what time will it come? When shall that crie</div>
<div class="t0"><i>The Bridegroome's comming</i>! fill the sky?</div>
<div class="t4">Shall it in the evening run,</div>
<div class="t4">When our words and works are done?</div>
<div class="t0">Or will thy all-surprising light</div>
<div class="t4">Break at midnight?</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_259">[259]</div>

<p>He broods over it till nothing else is present to
him in the night-watches:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">I saw Eternity the other night</div>
<div class="t0">Like a great ring of calm and endless light.</div>
</div>

<p>The history of the struggles and corruption of
mankind may close at any moment, in the twinkling
of an eye, at a signal given:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">All's in deep sleep and night; thick darkness lyes</div>
<div class="t2">And hatcheth o'er thy people--</div>
<div class="t0">But hark! what trumpet's that, what angel cries</div>
<div class="t2"><i>Arise! Thrust in thy sickle!</i></div>
</div>

<p>Here is a religious poet indeed, a visionary, a
mystic, and a Christian; none of which names can
be truly applied to Milton. And if we wish to
find Love enjoying his just supremacy in poetry,
we cannot do better than seek him among the
lyrists of the Court of Charles II. Milton, self-sufficient
and censorious, denies the name of love
to these songs of the sons of Belial. Love, he
says, reigns and revels in Eden, not</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t10">in court amours,</div>
<div class="t0">Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball,</div>
<div class="t0">Or serenate, which the starved lover sings</div>
<div class="t0">To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.</div>
</div>

<p>Yet for the quick and fresh spirit of love in
the poetry of that time we must go to the sons
of Belial. There is a pathetic passage in one of
Milton's divorce pamphlets, where, speaking of
<span class="pb" id="pg_260">[260]</span>
the unhappy choices in marriage to which "soberest
and best governed men" are liable, he remarks:--"It
is not strange though many, who have spent
their youth chastely, are in some things not so
quick-sighted while they haste too eagerly to
light the nuptial torch; nor is it therefore that for
a modest error a man should forfeit so great a
happiness, and no charitable means to release him,
since they who have lived most loosely, by reason
of their bold accustoming, prove most successful
in their matches, because their wild affections,
unsettling at will, have been as so many divorces
to teach them experience."</p>

<p>The wild affections, unsettling at will, wrote
better love-songs than the steadfast principles of
the sober and well-governed. Roystering libertines
like Sir Charles Sedley were more edifying
lovers than the austere husbands of Mary Powell
and of Eve. Milton would have despised and detested
the pleasure-seeking philosophy of Sedley:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Let us then ply those joys we have,</div>
<div class="t0">'Tis vain to think beyond the grave;</div>
<div class="t0">Out of our reach the Gods have laid</div>
<div class="t2">Of Time to come th' event,</div>
<div class="t0">And laugh to see the Fools afraid</div>
<div class="t2">Of what the Knaves invent.</div>
</div>

<p>But the self-abandonment and the passion of two
or three of Sedley's songs are out of Milton's
reach:--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_261">[261]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Not <i>Celia</i> that I juster am,</div>
<div class="t">Or better than the rest,</div>
<div class="t0">For I would change each hour like them,</div>
<div class="t">Were not my heart at rest.</div>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">But I am ty'd to very thee</div>
<div class="t">By every thought I have,</div>
<div class="t0">Thy face I only care to see,</div>
<div class="t">Thy heart I only crave.</div>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">All that in woman is ador'd</div>
<div class="t">In thy dear self I find,</div>
<div class="t0">For the whole sex can but afford</div>
<div class="t">The handsome and the kind.</div>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Why should I then seek further store,</div>
<div class="t">And still make love anew;</div>
<div class="t0">When change itself can give no more,</div>
<div class="t">'Tis easie to be true.</div>
</div>

<p>It is like a cup of cold water after the didactic endearments
of Adam, and his repeated apostrophe:</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve--</div>
<div class="t0">For such thou art, from sin and blame entire.</div>
</div>

<p>Then there was John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester.
He was drunk for five years on end,--so his
biographer, who had it from his own lips, alleges--and
he died at the age of thirty-two. Like
Sedley, he professes no virtues, and holds no far-reaching
views. But what a delicate turn of
personal affection he gives to the expression of his
careless creed:--</p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_262">[262]</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">The time that is to come is not,</div>
<div class="t">How can it then be mine?</div>
<div class="t0">The present moment's all my lot,</div>
<div class="t0">And that, as fast as it is got,</div>
<div class="t">Phyllis, is only thine.</div>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Then talk not of inconstancy,</div>
<div class="t">False hearts, and broken vows</div>
<div class="t0">If I by miracle can be</div>
<div class="t0">This live-long minute true to thee,</div>
<div class="t">'Tis all that Heaven allows.</div>
</div>

<p>Rochester's best love-poetry reaches the topmost
pinnacle of achievement in that kind. None has
ever been written more movingly beautiful than
this:--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">When, wearied with a world of woe,</div>
<div class="t">To thy safe bosom I retire,</div>
<div class="t0">Where love and peace and truth does flow,</div>
<div class="t">May I contented there expire!</div>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Lest, once more wandering from that heaven,</div>
<div class="t">I fall on some base heart unblest--</div>
<div class="t0">Faithless to thee, false, unforgiven--</div>
<div class="t">And lose my everlasting rest!</div>
</div>

<p>Or than that other piece (too beautiful and too
intense to be cited as a sudden illustration of a
thesis) beginning--</p>

<div class="verse">
<div class="t0">Why dost thou shade thy lovely face? O why</div>
<div class="t0">Does that eclipsing hand of thine deny</div>
<div class="t0">The sunshine of the Sun's enlivening eye?</div>
</div>

<p>The wind bloweth where it listeth; the
wandering fire of song touches the hearts and lips
<span class="pb" id="pg_263">[263]</span>
of whom it will. Milton built an altar in the
name of the Lord, and he made a great trench
about the altar, and he put the wood in order, and
loaded the altar with rich exotic offerings, cassia
and nard, odorous gums and balm, and fruit
burnished with golden rind. But the fire from
Heaven descended on the hastily piled altars of
the sons of Belial, and left Milton's gorgeous altar
cold.</p>

<p>His fame is now old-established and settled, so
there is no place left for the eloquence of the
memorialist, or the studied praises of the pleader.
I have tried to understand Milton; and have
already praised him as well as I know how, with
no stinted admiration, I trust, and certainly with
no merely superstitious reverence. If I must
round my discourse by repeating something that I
have already said or suggested, it shall be this--that
as he stands far aloof from his contemporaries,
so in the succession of great figures that mark for
us the centuries of our literature he is seen once
more singular and a stranger. We bred Shakespeare
in our Midlands; he was nourished from
the soil that still grows our daily bread. But
Milton was an alien conqueror. The crowd of
native-born Puritans, who sometimes (not without
many searchings of heart and sharp misgivings)
attempt to claim him for their leader, have no
title in him. It is a proof of his dominating
<span class="pb" id="pg_264">[264]</span>
power, and no credit to their intelligence, that
they accept him as their representative. His
influence on the destinies and history of our
literature might be compared to the achievement
of Napoleon while he was winning the victories
that changed the map of Europe. He could not
change the character of a people, nor perpetuate his
dynasty. But nothing is as it would have been
without him. Our literature is as hospitable as
the Hindoo pantheon; the great revolutionary has
won a place even in our creed. And the writer
has this advantage, at least, over the conqueror
and legislator, that he has bequeathed to us not
maps, nor laws, but poems, whose beauty, like the
World's unwithered countenance, is bright as at
the day of their creation.</p>
